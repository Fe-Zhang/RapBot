Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack
Take you back
Do do do do

(Aaaah... ya!)

[ Bret E.B. (& Sean E.B.) ]
(From the streets) cometh a man
(A fighter) doin the best that I can
(To survive) yes, and it's survival of the fittest
Strive for what is mine, the Lord is my witness
Many believe in what they see
(And I wonder) what do they see in me
For a man, he must walk alone
(To grow) and to bring his knowledge home
School of hard knocks is my alma mater
Lady Luck, you know that I got her
Fame and fortune never a concern
(I got mine) so to home I return

(Aaaah... ya!)

[ Frank Stallone ]
Take you back
Do do do do

Take you baaaack

Take me to home sweet home

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

I wanna gooooooo

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

Take me home

[ Sean E.B. (& Bret E.B.) ]
Touched many lives and seen many faces
Stood my ground in many different places
Mingled with the rich, a product of the poor
(Poor) in cash flow, and nothing more
(Pride) I'm proud of where I come from
(Friends) sometimes I thought I had none
Life is funny, it throws many curves
(Confusion) it gets on my nerves
Never thought about the pains and the tears
All I heard was the chants and cheers
You're a champ, now what you gonna do
(When it's true) you don't believe in you

(Aaaah... ya!)

[ Frank Stallone ]
Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

...home sweet home

Take you back
Do do do do
Take you baaaack

Take me hooooooooome
( ? )
Home again
Take me hooooooooome

[ Sean E.B. (& Bret E.B.) ]
(A challenge) my nature is to meet it
If I quit, then the purpose is defeated
A gamble (you see I gotta take the chance
Or in the mirror at myself I cannot glance)
Never run and hide, gotta take a stand
(Or feel like a coward and I'll doubt the man
In myself) with that I cannot live
They takin all I have to give
Destined (for what I know
Search for answers, so in my soul I roll
In the beginning) everything was good
Age and wisdom (says I return to the hood)

[ Frank Stallone ]
