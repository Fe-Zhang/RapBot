[Intro]

{Sara Johnston} Hi my name is stereo Mike
{radio announcer} Yeah, we got free tickets to the Bran Van concert
Happening this Monday night at the Pacific Coliseum. You can all call in
If you want to answer a couple of questions, mainly 'what is Todd's
Favorite cheese?' Ah, Jackie just called in and said it was a type of
Roquefort, whatever that is. Give us a ring-a-ding-ding. It's a beautiful day
{Steve 'Liquid' Hawley} Yeah Todd, this is Liquid ring-a-ding-dinging. I
Want those free Bran Van tickets man. Where you at... Todd...

[James Di Salvo]
I woke up this morning with the sun in my eyes
When Mike came over with a script surprise
A mafioso story with a twist
A To Wong Fu-Julie Newmar Hitch
"Get your ass out of bed!" he said I'll explain it on the way

[Sara Johnston] - singing
But we did nothing, absolutely nothing that day
And I say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at 26?
I got the fever for the flavour
Know the payback will be later
Still I need a fix

[James Di Salvo]
And the girls on the bus kept laughing at us
As we rode on the 10 down to Venice again
Blaring out the g-funk sipping on juice and gin
Just me and a friend feeling kind of groovy workin' on a movie (yeah
Right)

[Sara Johnston] - singing
But we did nothing, absolutely bupkis that day
And I say, what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at 26?
(With my mind on my money and my money on my BEER!)
I know that life is for the taking
So I better wise up and take it quick (one more time at Trader Vic's)

[James Di Salvo]
Where some men there wanted to hurt us
And other men said we weren't worth the fuss
You could catch 'em all bitching by the bar
About the fine line between the rich and the poor
Then Mike turned to me and said "what you think we get done son?"

[Sara Johnston] - singing
We found the conclusion and I guess that's something... right?
So I ask you what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at 26?
I got the fever for the nectar know the payback will be later
Still I need a fix
Hell-A-L.A.! Hell hell-A.L.A (REPEAT 3 times)
So I ask you what the hell am I doing drinking in L.A. at 26?
