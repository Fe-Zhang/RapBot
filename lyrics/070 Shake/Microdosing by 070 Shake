[Intro]
Hey
What?
Yeah
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

[Verse 1]
You're so afraid to damage your image
Ask forgiveness, not for permission
You can't erase us, it's already written
Baby, you did forget that meaning, meaning, meaning
I don't wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
I don't wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing

[Chorus]
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

[Verse 2]
Just went hay, we went haywire
Horns that stick out your halo
Get in your head, sentimental
It's bye, but can see you later
Oh, live in the present
There's magic here, what you say, oh?
Yeah, yeah, now I'm doin' what I said, oh
There's too much bags for me to settle

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, I just want a little
Oh-oh, I just want a little
Oh-oh, I just want a little
Oh-oh, I just want a little

[Chorus]
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you
Microdosing
I was just microdosing you

[Outro]
Yeah, baby, did you forget that meaning, meaning, meaning?
I don't wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
I don't wanna be your everything
'Cause I don't wanna leave you with nothing
