[Verse]
No pigmentation, giving you the blues
Suffering from FOMO, she could come, too
Screaming out YOLO,  jumping off the roof
One more drink, one less I'll (Lose)
She's betting on science, she say she needs proof
If I was out of my body, you would see the truth
And my brains bruised from all of the bad news
And my brains bruised from all of the bad news
Lost her only son and he wasn't even three
Now try telling her that everything is meant to be
It's hard to believe a vision you can't see
But tell me, have you looked at the air that you breathe?
The balance in me split by three
I sold my mind and my flesh
They don't get the context 'cause it's too complex
I was in my highest, I was in my high

[Chorus]
Said, oh, I'll never know
How long I'll stay, how far I'll go
Said, oh, I'll never know
How long I'll stay, how far I'll go

[Outro]
Astronaut
Answer now like an astronaut
Get alcohol like an astronaut
Area code like astronaut, yeah-yeah
Tragedy
You turned a good thing to a tragedy
Being held down by gravity
Baby, hoping you can see the map
Good night to all of you, wherever you are

[Interlude]
I prefer the pain, you tellin' me
I know you haven't said a prayer in a month or so
You givin' up your faith for some fun, yeah
I don't feel the rain or the sun, no (Oh-oh)
Not the sun, no, not the sun, no
Not the sun, no, not the sun, no
Feeling safe with your love song
She feeling safe with your love song
Girl, I'm in love, hope you feelin' in love, too
