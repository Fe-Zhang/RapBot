[Intro]
I need to let go
But I don't wanna go out lonely
Right now I need to grow
And no one's gonna do that for me
And my bags all stowed
Were you thinking 'bout stayin' by me?
Yeah, you thinking 'bout stayin'? Woah
Yeah, you thinking 'bout stayin'?

[Verse 1]
Oh, gotta go (Go)
Right now, I gotta go
Headed home to a different time zone, yeah
Sun is low, yeah, everything is goin' right, yeah
'Til she told me, where she slept last night, yeah
Where'd you go, yeah, when the sun came down? Yeah
Karma knows, yeah, it'll come back around, yeah
Fire's high, babe, don't you let it go out, yeah
The fire's high, babe, don't you let it go out

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, where did you sleep last night? (Last night, night)
Where did you sleep last night? (Last night)
Oh, where did you sleep last night? (Last night)
Where did you sleep?

[Chorus]
The pines, the pines, the pines, where the sun don't ever
Shine, shine, shine, where the sun don't ever
Shine, shine, shine, where the sun don't ever
Shine, shine, shine, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you can keep your bad advice, yeah
She was on me like white on rice
I already killed my ego twice
So sorry, it'll cause another bad fight
Yes, I'm young, but I know just what I like, yeah
Yes, I'm young, but I know just what I like
Yes, I'm young, but I know just what I like, yeah, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you sleep last night?
Oh, where did you sleep last night? (Last night, night)
Where did you sleep last night?

[Chorus]
The pines, the pines, the pines, where the sun don't ever
Shine, shine, shine, where the sun don't ever
Shine, shine, shine, where the sun don't ever
Shine, shine, shine, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]
The pines, the pines, the pines, where the sun don't ever
Shine (Shine), shine (Shine), shine (Shine), where the sun don't ever
Shine (Shine), shine (Shine), shine (Shine), where the sun don't ever
Shine (Shine), shine (Shine), shine (Shine), yeah-yeah, yeah
