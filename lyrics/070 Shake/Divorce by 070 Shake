[Intro]
Hm-mm
Why'd you ever say you wanna (Oh-oh, oh)
Leave me? (Oh-oh, oh)
Only see you in the morning (Oh-oh, oh)

[Verse]
Fun is comin' kinda late this summer
Every day you run away from somethin'
You don't know just why you hate this someone
But you wanna know why you spilled your wine
Gemini, see both sides
Trade this ring for peace inside
In plain sight, wavin' my arms, Heaven's alright
Bones and soil fertilize
Face your fear and face the truth
Me and you, we were one
That was once, but now we're two (Why'd you ever say you wanna⁠—)
Me and you, we were one
That was once, but now we're two
Played along all along
We both did things we know were wrong

[Outro]
Leave me (I think we need a, we need a divorce, oh-oh, oh)
(We might need a divorce)
Only see you in the morning (Oh-oh, oh)
