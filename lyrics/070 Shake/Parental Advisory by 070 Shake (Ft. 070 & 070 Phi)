[Verse 2: Phi]
I'm like "Baby, you actin' shady"
Most these niggas, they be crazy (crazy)
They be lazy (lazy)
I be on it on the daily
I got nothing to lose now
You know how I want it, baby
This the life I choose now
Makin' all the rules now
I just thought I'd make my own
She was looking kinda good
And I just thought I'd take her home
We be gettin' lit
Living for the moment
She knows if it's good then I'm in it 'til the mornin'
You know I be on it
I do this shit for real
Sebastian on the beats and we be cooking all the meals
I swear these niggas lookin' like they don't know the deal
I'm lookin' back at 'em like "What the fuck is real?"
Why they made me spill on it?
