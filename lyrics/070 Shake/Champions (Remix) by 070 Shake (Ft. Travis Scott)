[Intro: Travis Scott]
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go

[Verse: 070 Shake & Travis Scott]
And why you keep on askin' what if I ain't had this?
And we just go right at it and I tell you not to panic
'Cause no one understanding us, no one's understanding us
You say I'm a champion so they can't even handle us
Move, I'm in a rush today, for heaven's sake
And I just ate a bunch today, another plate
And I can't really fly, bro, elevate
And really you should travel, meditate
And we been gettin' high, bro, you kinda late
And really all they wanted was for me to graduate
And hang the fucking tassel, but what comes after?
Welcome to the cult, tell the mass I'm a master (Yeah)
I said "fuck religion" and (Fif-) I mated with the pastor
My buddy hit a hundo and I tell him "Go faster"
I'll slay dragon, and then I'll keep the castle
Chasin' all my dreams
If I has to, then I has to
If I has to, then I has to
If I has to, then I has to
If I has to, then I has to
I'm dangerous, ain't no motherfucker taming us
What, what
And who's stopping me? They don't say a thing right now
I'm an animal, I cannot be tamed right now
No time for this ,don't know why I came right now
I'm a champion, got too much to change right now
Quite confident, pretty with chains on now
Red, blue, yellow angels in the scene
Red, blue, yellow angels on my team
Red, blue, yellow angels that I'm seein' (Yeah)

[Outro: Travis Scott]
1500, all in singles (Straight up)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
