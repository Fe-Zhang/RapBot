[Verse 1]
How they got inside, oh, really, I don't know
Can't keep lettin' randoms up inside your home
You drink too much to know, you drink too much to know
Spirits in your blood, it's seeping through your soul
Garden needs some water, garden needs some water
Look up to the sky and I feel closer to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Get on, get even
Get on with your killer two-piece
Look up for me
Not far, baby, even when you leave

[Chorus]
Hmm-mmh
What happen under the moon
It stays under the moon (Moon)
It stays under the moon (Moon)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high

[Verse 2]
Me, I'm gonna have less than a little bit
Or I might just take the rest and a little bit
We all know how it ends when you're giving in
Fuck it, for the night, we can live in it
Under the same sky when you're missin' it
Look at what you did again
Inside 'til the morning, 'til I feel like
'Til the moon's out, 'til the lights out, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Get on, get even
Get on with your killer two (Two-piece)
Get on the street (Yeah)
Not far even when you leave
When you leave

[Chorus]
What happen under the moon
It stays under the moon
It stays under the moon

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high

[Outro]
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
I wanna get high, high
I wanna get high
