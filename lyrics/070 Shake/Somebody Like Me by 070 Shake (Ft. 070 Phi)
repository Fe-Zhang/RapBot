[Verse 1: 070 Shake]
Ah, uh-uh, ah
I saved you from the ring, from the ring of fire
Uh, now you let me fill all your desires
Does this make you think? Does this make you shout?
Does this make you think? Does this make you think?
Does this make you shout?
Open it up
Every time you blink, every time you blink
The darkness is around
Roaming through the streets, lonely as can be
Every time you sneeze, God don't bless you, God blessing me
Ah, and don't be walking all alone
'Cause these thoughts are unpure just like yours
Don't be walking all alone, don't be walking all alone
Don't be walking all alone

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Name somebody like me, oh
Tell me who sings to you like me, oh woah
Name somebody like me, oh woah
Tell me who sings to you like me, uh
Name somebody like me
Won't you tell me who sings to you like me
Woah woah, woah woah, woah woah
Won't you tell me who sings to you like me

[Verse 2: 070 Phi]
Peace and prosperity on my mental
You keep looking for clarity, I don't get you
Care to be in this rental, I'm looking for ownership
They brought us in here together, I'm looking to own this ship
Like, like, I woke up like Johnny Depp
The lone ranger in the dark shadows
Donnie Brasco tryin' to infiltrate the castle
'Cause they fear the black masses
A public enemy 'cause I ain't here to kiss no asses
We just needed transcendence in this world
Where your friend could be your foe
Waiting for you to blow, coming for what I'm owed
Ain't no fear and nobody cares to wipe away your tears over here, baby

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Name somebody like me, oh
Tell me who sings to you like me, oh woah
Name somebody like me, oh woah
Tell me who sings to you like me

[Outro: 070 Phi]
Walking alone, yeah, I'm walking alone
Walking alone, walking alone
Walking alone, yeah, I'm walking alone
Walking alone
Walking alone, yeah, I'm walking alone
