[Intro]
Waking up by the trees
I don't wanna leave
Something's wrong with me
Catch my drift?
Wake up by the leaves
I don't wanna leave
Something's wrong with me, something

[Chorus]
Make it there tonight, make it there tonight
Tonight
Make it there tonight, make it there tonight
Make it there tonight
One, one, one time
One, one, one time
One, one, one time
Make it there
One, one, one time
One, one, one time
One time, one time

[Verse 1]
Did it cause of pity said, "Hello," grab my stuff
Called my niggas and I left
I'mma do it for the city for my town
With the squad on the map and we set
Oh, you wanna run things when I'm done with ya?
Hun have fun, that's a bet
Oh you wanna be a fake mo'fucka for the fame change it up for a check
God I hope I don't change
If I roll up in a Civic
If I roll up in a Range
Hope I roll up the same
You do not know my name
Name tags for the lames
Cloudy skies, what a day
All these lonely beds got me restless
You don't know who to call, get the message
No problems man, my niggas stay stress-less
Stay stress-less, stay stress-less

[Chorus]
Make it there tonight, make it there tonight
Tonight
Make it there tonight, make it there tonight
Make it there tonight
One, one, one time
One, one, one time
One, one, one time
Make it there
One, one, one time
One, one, one time
One time, one time

[Verse 2]
When I was younger Mama told me that
She wanna live in Texas (Texas!)
Had a lot of trouble in the city
It was getting too hectic
Cyphers in the school skipping class and
We always acting reckless
Had a teacher always said I wasn't shit
Now she wanna send a message
Talking 'bout remember all the old days
Talking 'bout remember all the lessons
To be honest, I don't remember
I left my past in December
Live in the clouds with the embers
Mix it all up like a blender
You can't drink you ain't a member
Please excuse my temper
Shawty straight but I had to bend her
You don't wanna see us on the dance floor
If you ain't getting lit then you can't come
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 070, so a snitch ain't one
Shorty wanna chase but I'm on the run
See the colors drippin' down your throat
And I appreciate you so much more
Cause you look even better
You look even better than you usually do
I think I'm gettin' used to you
Cause she looks even better, better, better
Than the regu-regu-regular

[Outro]
Make it tonight, make it tonight
Make it tonight, make it tonight
Make it tonight, make it tonight
One
