[Verse 1]
Gave you all the secrets, now you creepin' in the window
3 AM, I'm boozin' on my body while the wind blow
Singing to the people, I sit back and watch my sins blow
Do you get down like that?
Do you really get down like that?
Took it in, you got to mash right back
Buckle up, 'cause that ass might crash, yuh

[Chorus]
And I don't really trust nobody
And I don't really trust nobody
And I don't really trust nobody
'Cause I don't really trust no, trust no
Trust no one, unless you give me your soul
Ooh, give me your soul
Ooh, give me your, give me your...

[Verse 2]
Chucky's coming, get to running, if you wanna live your life
Baby, stay around the sun, the creeps gon' find you in the night
In the night, in the night, in the night, yuh
Movin' on and we ain't looking back for what we left
Leave the crib at 3 AM to cop a cigarette
Just figured out the plan and I'ma stick with it
Hard to talk to people now, 'cause I'm just different
I lost my mind so many times, not scared of losing friends
I gave my all and now I don't have anything to lend

[Bridge]
You don't understand the switch up
Look inside the bigger picture
You just want to take me with ya
Wait a lil', when the pill gon hit ya
You don't understand the switch up
Look inside the bigger picture

[Chorus]
And I don't really trust nobody
And I don't really trust nobody
And I don't really trust nobody
And I don't really trust no, trust no
Trust no, unless you give me your soul
Ooh, give me your soul
Ooh, give me your, give me your
Give me your soul, give me your soul

[Outro]
Chucky's coming, get to running, if you wanna live your life
Baby, stay around the sun, the creeps gon' find you in the night
Chucky's coming, get to running, if you wanna live your life
Baby, stay around the sun, the creeps gon' find you in the night
In the night, in the night
