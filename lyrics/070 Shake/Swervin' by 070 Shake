[Chorus]
I fell asleep with the lights on last night
I had a dream I was swervin' in the fast life
And all I think about is oblivion
And all I really want is a million

[Verse 1]
I don't need to redemption, your complexion made me lose direction
I lost all reception wifi, wifi need inspection
This a warning, man I might just get reckless
What a rush, man I might just get arrested
I might just go on the top just to fuck with this girl
All this time invested, better hope I rest up
I might just get invested for a million, damn like all the fucking time
I don't need a knife, nigga
I just need the money
Oh, she is so fine, I just told myself "Why the fuck you gotta hide?"
Cause I got all this pain, nigga
I don't need to die, why I gotta lie
Fight for what is mine
I just wait on line and I just waste my time
Can you give me a sign? What you see by night?
But, but (Oh)
Why you only get with me when I get numb?
And why you always back when you say you're dumb?
And why you only coming when you lost my love?
You hit my line like we gotta talk about sumn, though
You know, oh well
You like these robes
Top flow, you suck
I'm on, you suck
But fuck it, memories fade
I'll just wait on the day when you hit my line with a "hey"
Got something to say
I made a mistake, I thought that I needed a break
Don't matter to me, I just wanna get paid
That fun in the sun, just to play in the shade

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with the lights on last night
I had a dream I was swervin' in the fast life
And all I think about is oblivion
And all I really want is a million

[Verse 2]
I sent a message and I hope you comprehend it, every
Word yes, I meant it
But that room in the city that you rented
Get your money back, please don't feel offended
I know it's a lot of time that we invested
I kinda feel infested, I think we should rest it
So maybe we could miss it
I'll hit you on Thanksgiving, you'll say "how's life ?"
I'll say "Thank god we living on the underground"
Buried, hidden, where exposure is forbidden
And I'm sitting on this pedestal, where all my sins are written
I ran in for the killin', oh well now we winnin'
Cause I'm from a world where your mind counts, not your body counts
Search my soul, take a look around
Tell me what you found, my eyes they yelling love
You can ring my phone, I don't need to know
Tell me if you down, we can smoke a pound
I am not a child, we can do this ting
We can do a lot, I don't need a [?]
We could go so high, I don't need to see
Cause I'll never think like the person I used to be
And we never leaving, we follow the same routine, same routine

[Chorus]
I fell asleep with the lights on last night
I had a dream I was swervin' in the fast life
And all I think about is oblivion
And all I really want is a million

[Outro]
Everybody got a dream, everybody want to see
