[Chorus]
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need

[Verse]
Who you, who I?
Blue eye, blue eye
Fine line, fine line
We fallin' behind

[Chorus]
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
Come around with your love, oh, baby, I'm in need
