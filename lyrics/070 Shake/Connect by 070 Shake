[Intro]
Hey, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Heartbeat sharply, marked by sharpie, not me
Mark me godly try and, taught me mark Pete Johnny
And the rest will walk me, got peace
No piece, never
Action talking madly
Happy, sadly, angry, don't you feel me?
Why are your words so trapped​?​ (Just remember I am the 13, 13, 13)

[Chrous]
Let me talk to you
Connect, connect, connect
(I'm the 12th disciple on the 13, 13)
And what's wrong with you
Let's connect, connect, connect
(I'm the 12th disciple on the 13, 13)
Go and call your connects, connects, connects
(I'm the 12th disciple on the 13, 13)
To get you high and forget about the rest

[Bridge]
Cause you rather keep it quiet
You never say enough
You rather let the silence
Take control of us


[Bridge]
Cause you rather keep it quiet
You never say enough
You rather let the silence
Take control of us


[Verse 2]
O-oh you gotta tell me how you found it (oh yeah)
Cool, you say what you know about it? (oh yeah)
And why did you come just for that? (Why just for that?)
And why are your words all so trash? (Tell me, tell me, oh)
But your body free, let me have a piece
Physically, get you mentally
Sexually, just vent to me
Spiritually, connect to me
Now you know what you meant to me
You all talk, you ain't gotta talk, give me something bae
8 o'clock in the front, give me something bae
To the party, pop a molly, now we going crazy
Now I'm contemplating, now I'm crazy
Taking her to the place she stay
And hoping that she fucking says
O-oh, you gotta tell me how you found it (oh yeah)
Cool, you say what you know about it? (oh yeah)
Cool, you sang it, tell me how it sounded? (yeah)
You read it​, and what you really think about it?
Oh what you really think about it? (Bout it, bout it, bout it)

[Chorus]
Let me talk to you
Connect, connect, connect
And what's wrong with you?
Let's connect, connect, connect
Go and call your connects, connects, connects
To get you high and forget about the rest

[Verse 3]
And still I seek this path of un-manifestation
Battling with lust and each his own temptations
Greeting waiting in the shadows times somebody give me patience
You forgotten it was temporary fell in love with this vacation
Dark paths, marked ass, the kill of lumination
Cutless and patents waiting for me by the station
Once your gone this all becomes and animation
Unreal and unable to have a motherfucking conversation
A moth- conversation

[Bridge]
Cause you rather keep it quiet
You never say enough
You rather let the silence
Take control of us


[Outro]
Heartbeat sharply, marked by sharpie, not me
Mark me godly try and, taught me mark Pete Johnny
And the rest will walk me, got peace
No piece, never
Action talking madly
Happy, sadly, angry, don't you feel me?
