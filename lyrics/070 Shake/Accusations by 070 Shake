[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go I'm hearing something
Baby, stop making things out of nothing
Am I the one to blame? three years, still the same
I talk still nothing is changed
I had to go, you called me rude
I did it for us, I did it for you
A hundred below, high on the roof
Was tryna get close, you tell me to move, oh, ah
Tell me, do you wanna stop?
Before I get up to the top
Click clack pow, just take your shot
I won't wait, I've had enough, yeah
2 AM, my mind's on us
All my friends out to the club
Saw you there, they said you're numb
Numb to the pain, oh how you changed
It's not 'bout the girls, it's not 'bout the fame
Blowin' the clouds, tonight it will rain
You havin' fun, this isn't a game, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Double up, your love is not enough
Thank you for your accusations
Thank you for your accusations
Thank you for your accusations
Double up, your love is not enough
Thank you for your accusations
Thank you for your accusations
Thank you for your accusations

[Verse 2]
Me and all my buddies rock rock 'til we on the top top with a drop top, yeah
Jumpin' on this thing like hopscotch, all these other niggas all talk talk, yeah
Me and all my friends, we a mess are you tryna drop lock with the mop mop?
Walk away, oh she's gone, 'cause I love the drugs
Another one, one more time, and I swear I'm done
'Cause everything that you've done is not enough
It's not enough, it's not enough
I am all alone, baby do you want to come?
Sunflower fields, I just wanna run
Girl you rubbin' off, I think I'm pretty numb
Sippin' on these things and I don't care about the love, yeah-eah
I need you to listen to me
She's locked in a prison all alone, yeah
Baby won't you listen to me
I am in this mission on my own, yeah
It's been long but you come, girl, you switched it up
All this time I was wrong, you did it for the love
So everything that you've done is not enough
It's not enough, yeah, uh, what

[Chorus]
Double up, your love is not enough
Thank you for your accusations
Thank you for your accusations
Thank you for your accusations

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Thank you for these accusations, thank you, oh
Thank you for these accusations, thank you
It's been long but you come, girl, you switched it up
All this time I was wrong, you did it for the love
So everything that you've done is not enough
It's not enough
I'm alone, baby do you wanna come?
Sunflower fields, girl I just want to run
Girl you rubbin' off
Ayy yo, start that from the beginning
