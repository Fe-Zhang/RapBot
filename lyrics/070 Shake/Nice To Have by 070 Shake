[Intro]
It's nice to have someone to hold you
Tell you they chose you
Someone you can't fool 'cause they know you
Nice to have someone to love you
Come to your bed in the night when you're alone
Nice to have someone to love you (Mmm, mmm)
Ayy, nice to have someone to love you

[Verse 1]
You said you were done, yeah
But you're over here naked, yeah
In the middle of the day-ay, uh
I ain't even close the shades, yeah
I don't give a fuck, yeah, I still stay there
Sometimes I wanna feel the pain, yeah, uh
So squeeze my heart all day
Squeeze it 'til it breaks in
Fuck what they say, I'm safe in your arms
And if I die in your arms
There'll be a smile on my face, yeah
A smile on my face in your arms

[Chorus]
Nice to have someone to care for you (Ooh)
Be there for you
Someone that'd take a dare for you (Ooh)
Yeah, and in the morning when you wake up
Yeah, she stares at you
Like you're the only thing there for her
And the memories die
And I'm glad you were there for it
Yeah, I'm glad you were there (For it)
(For it, for it, for it) And the memories die
And I'm glad you were there for it (For it, for it, for it)

[Verse 2]
Give me just a second, in the city gettin' faded
I'm a star, don't you forget it, gettin' rich, I'm still a menace
Foot on the gas, goin' fast on the track, keep rollin'
I'ma make it last like the laughs keep goin'
I'm hungry for the morning, no taste
And I'm on the run now and we ain't get to touch base
I sent you texts to let you know that I was home safe
But that wasn't the point, babe, you just wanna talk later

[Bridge]
'Cause at nights, you can't sleep
Spendin' the day thinkin' who you gon' be (Ahh)
Lookin' at the models all up on the screen
Thinkin', "That should be me up on the TV"
(We're comin' home tonight, big hurry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's nice to have someone to care for you (Ooh)
Be there for you
Someone that'd take a dare for you (Ooh)
Yeah, and in the morning when you wake up
Yeah, she stares at you
Like you're the only thing there for her (For her)
And the memories die
And I'm glad you were there for it
Yeah, I'm glad you were there for it (There for)
There for it, there for it, you were there for it (There for it)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
