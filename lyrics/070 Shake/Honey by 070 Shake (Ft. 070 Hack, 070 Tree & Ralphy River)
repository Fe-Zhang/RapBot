[Intro: 070 Shake]
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
Shake that ass, Julz

[Verse 1: 070 Shake]
We haven't talked in months
Fun just isn't fun
I barely even eat anymore
And we don't cry for sleep anymore
There's something I may try
This drink doesn't taste right
It wasn't like our drunk nights, drunk nights
It wasn't like our drunk nights, drunk nights
It wasn't like our drunk nights
We haven't talked in months
Fun just isn't fun
I barely even eat anymore
And we don't cry for sleep anymore
There's something I may try
This drink doesn't taste right
It wasn't like our drunk nights
Like our drunk, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: 070 Shake]
But do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?
Butterflies
I know you feel it in your tummy, tummy, tummy

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
And you sting like a bee
Like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
And you sting like a bee
Like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
Hey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
But you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
Sting like a bee, sting like a bee

[Bridge: Ralphy River]
You made a mess out of me
Showed me things I couldn't see
You didn't know what that'd do to me
Yeah you made a mess out of me
You made a mess out of me
Showed me things I couldn't see
You didn't know what that'd do to me
You made a mess out of me, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Ralphy River]
Lockin' lips
We in Jersey, baby, rock your hips
Rock, rock, rock your hips
Show me all that confidence
My purity is prominent
And this is sophisticated dominance
And I've been, runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
I've been runnin' 'round revolvin' doors
And she's so stunnin', stunnin', stunnin', stunnin'
I can see it comin' out her pores
And it's nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
To somebody like me
Somebody like me

[Pre-Chorus: 070 Shake]
But do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
(You know you love me, baby, come on, come on)
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?
Butterflies
I know you feel it in your tummy, tummy, tummy

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
And you sting like a bee
Like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
And you sting like a bee
Like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
Hey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
But you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
Sting like a bee, sting like a bee

[Verse 3: 070 Hack]
One more time, tell me one more lie, girl
One more chance or I'll give you to the world
Tell me what you really wanna do
Girl I gots to
Girl I gots to
I gots to know
I don't wanna hold you back no more, no
With this love, with this love, with this love, oh
And do you still think you're funny, funny, funny?
Funny, funny, funny

[Pre-Chorus: 070 Shake]
And do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
And you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
But you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
Oh, but you sting like a bee, but you sting like a bee
But you sting like a bee

[Verse 4: 070 Shake]
You know I really hate it when you turn around
You know I really hate it when they talk you down
It don't gotta be what it has to be
Turn around and just dance with me
Now's when you're lookin' like I take control
Faster I go, the more you moan
Stop it now
You know I really hate it when you turn around
You know I really hate it when they talk you down
It don't gotta be what it has to be
So baby turn around and just dance with me
Turn around and just dance with me
Hey, dance with me
Oh, dance with me, yeah
Oh, dance with me
Dance, dance, dance, dance
To the left
Dance, dance, dance, dance
To the right
Dance, dance, dance, dance
To the left
Dance, dance, dance, dance
(What you say, Tree?)

[Bridge: Treee Safari]
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
(I abducted you)

[Outro: 070 Shake]
But do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?
Butterflies
I know you feel it in your tummy, tummy, tummy
But you sting like a bee
