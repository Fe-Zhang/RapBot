[Chorus]
Every night she said she wanted foreplay
She don't let her be her fuckin' self
Xannied out and I just popped a molly
Doctor say he worried 'bout my health
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self

[Verse 1]
Talk about rap niggas, talk about trap niggas
Know I'm the bitch but they sit on my lap niggas
I never cared even if they had figures
Walk in the crib with a dime and a Hilfiger
They ask me who I wanna be, I say my fuckin' self
Please just mind your business and don't worry 'bout my health
Sit me down, sit up, sit up, sit up
Stood up on and work it out
Pull up, push up, pull up
Pull up on 'em, sit me down
Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up on it
Don't catch the wave
We do not go with the flow, we create
We gon' look back just to see what we made
Bein' myself while you fake to get paid
To get paid, paid
Damn that sucks, they slaved us up
They watch us die, while they preach Pablo
We'll beat the system, we'll fuck it up
One more thing, fuck Donald Trump

[Chorus]
Every night she said she wanted foreplay
She don't let her be her fuckin' self
Xannied out and I just popped a molly
Doctor say he worried 'bout my health
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
Ask me who I love I say myself
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be my fuckin' self
I just wanna be myself
I just wanna be myself

[Verse 2]
E and J drippin' on my phone screen
I am in my zone so don't bug me
They see my flu's cold so they bring scene
My niggas see I'm loose so they bring trees
We do illegal things so don't bring these
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, baby fuck twelve
Myself, myself, baby, myself
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, baby fuck twelve
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, fuck twelve, fuck twelve
Let me be myself, myself, myself
Will not get away
Free me from the fakes
Free me from the wealth
Leave me by myself
Psych, 070, 'til the fuckin' top
Put my nigga up, shawty give him top
Niggas tryna join, boy you gotta stop
Treat her like a bus, now you gotta hop
Blowin' them trees, we need them cuffs, gotta stay clean
Bringin' 'em out, everyone jump
Knowing you will accomplish it
Oh I heard some comp, it's lit, yeah
You niggas gon' fold, we trip, hey

[Interlude]
Trippy life, trippy life, trippy life
Call us the Beatles, the hippy life
Trippy life, trippy life, trippy life
Call us the Beatles, the hippy life
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay
Uptown, uptown, uptown where I stay

[Outro]
Oh I feel the drip right now, ooh
I think I should sip right now, ooh
They just wanna change me
I'm still gettin' lit right now, yeah
I just wanna be my fuckin' self, yeah
I just wanna be my fuckin' self, yeah
I just wanna be my fuckin'
