[Hook: Shake070]
I'm just trynna get it on my own
And I don't wanna waste another day
Feeding off this energy
Keep it all one hunned we
Ain't gotta have no enemy, no
All I know is get it on my own
Sometimes I gotta wash the pain away
God I love my Hennessy
Keep it all one hunned we
Ain't gotta have no enemies no

[Verse 1: Phi]
Maybe we could all get money and relate to each other
An OG told me
Real men get it, don't take from another
And don't wait on another
I don't need no favors
Man I'm straight with my brothers
Love to drink with my brothers
Get to the bank with my brothers
Young nigga coming out straight from the gutter
Know that it's about the bread and the butter
But all I'm seeing is guns and them roses
Why do my people keep losing our soldiers
We 'posed to get it and spread out the culture
Boss up my nigga and live like a owner
This for my niggas that's setting they goals up
I can't wait til we go up
This is just the beginning
Stay to myself because nigga we winning
But I got love for my niggas that's getting it
I do not move with no malice
Trynna keep all of my balance
Sometimes it could be a challenge
I'm racking up on the mileage
I've been so long on this road
So far from home
I'm just a young Rolling Stone
Started with nothing
I made them decisions
How could you hate this persistence
I mean we came from a distance
Gotta be free and maintain on the mission
If they ain't talking that mean they ain't listening
All of my niggas is focused and ready to get it
You know we ain't lacking and slippin'
We on it and winnin'
And all of you niggas gon' feel it

[Hook: Shake070]
I'm just trynna get it on my own
And I don't wanna waste another day
Feeding off this energy
Keep it all one hunned we
Ain't gotta have no enemy, no
All I know is get it on my own
Sometimes I gotta wash the pain away
God I love my Hennessy
Keep it all one hunned we
Ain't gotta have no enemies, no

[Verse 2: Shake070]
When it's on the road
Who gon' run for us, yeah
Then would you get up out the [?] for us
We need the niggas with the joints for us, yeah
We grindin hard
Shit is real right now
Shake take a sip, sip, sip
They say have a nice trip
You'll be boolin on the rip, rip ohh
We was on the floor right now
Man I'm really feeling low right now
And she thinking 'bout the stove I know
I love the distraction
Destruction
Dysfunction
Erupting
I'm running from something so cunning
It's nothing
I'm bugging me to take my luggage
And leave out the country like Paris
It's stunning
I know I would love it
So neat it'd be numbing
I ask you don't bug me, yeahh
I ask you don't bug me, yeahh
Can you just respect the fact that I come and go
You got to accept the fact that you'll never know
We want to surprise them more so we lay low
So we lay low

[Hook: Shake070]
I'm just trynna get it on my own
And I don't wanna waste another day
Feeding off this energy
Keep it all one hunned we
Ain't gotta have no enemy, no
All I know is get it on my own
Sometimes I gotta wash the pain way
God I love my Hennessy
Keep it all one hunned we
Ain't gotta have no enemies, no

[Outro: Shake070]
I'm just trynna get it on my own
We was on the floor right now
Man I'm really feeling low right now
