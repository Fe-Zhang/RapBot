[Intro]
Designer bitch, yeah, hope you know you signin'
Night and day, fuck about what time it is
This won't get you high, don't ask me why I'm tryin' it
Designer bitch, she just want the finer things
And day, every day, give a fuck about what time it is
This won't get you high so don't you ask me why I'm tryin' it
Designer bitch
Night and day, every day, give a fuck about what time it is
This won't get you high so don't you ask me why I'm tryin' it
(How you know? How you know? How you know?)

[Chorus]
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know? How? How?
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know?
How you know?
Tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight
Tell it to me straight, or am I too much of a stranger? Stranger
My momma said, "Don't talk to strangers", like me
Baby I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger to you
Baby I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger to you

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you be ashamed, show your face if you feel a way
You know it's earlier when we sleep today
Don't you be ashamed, show your face if you feel a way
You know it's earlier when we sleep today
Took it to the left, we don't slow at all
Wicked, wicked rush, we don't stop at all
Took it to the left, we don't slow at all
Wicked, wicked rush, we don't stop at all

[Verse 1]
We ain't surprised, we doing fine, we-, we doing fine
Have you lost your mind? Oh, we doing fine, we-, we doing fine
I expected all of this from one of these niggas all around me
Only we live forever, so don't you ever time me
I expected this from all the niggas all around me
Only we live forever, so don't you think 'bout timin' me

[Chorus]
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know? How? How?
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know?
How you know?
Tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight
Tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight
