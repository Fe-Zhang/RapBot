[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Saturday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
She do it for the show, I didn't even know
Ooh, Sunday night

[Verse 1: 070 Shake]
Hit the lights I'm coming, sorry for the wait
I popped a tab and then my life turned to a maze
You just need to feel the pain, then maybe you'd be amazed
How in a blink it goes away, then you'll see that I'm not crazy
Maybe you'll see, maybe, nothing never faze me
I was clean a long long long long time ago
They fall one by one like a motherfucking domino
They tell you what to do like it is Simon says
Get this money chase it, she just wants the diamonds'
Rollies, Rollies, Rollies, Rollies
I do not have time for this, why do you come for me
I know you don't wanna see, some things, its just hard to believe
Till you breathe, soak it in, let it drip, smell the trees
Pour it up, don't ever leave, me alone with the piece
I might just pull, I might just cease to exist, like I'm Steez
Rest in peace, can you feel the fucking beat, beat, beat
We ain't looking for the peace, peace, peace
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I do not care bout what you think, think, think
I get my money like I'm Meng Meng Meng

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Sunday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road, hit the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
She do it for the show, I didn't even know
Ooh, Sunday night

[Verse 2: 070 Phi]
With the squad going hard in this bitch
We ain't never gone call it for quits
Stand tall, never fall, never slip, get a grip
Count it up, make it flip, and then ball in this bitch
I just feel like I deserve, everything that I earn
Even when its a loss, its something for me to learn
Story to tell, reason to toast
I've been through hell, swear its the most
Now I'm just feeling like I'm winning
All in the cameras I be grinning, young nigga chilling like a villain
Stack it until it hit the ceiling, then get a crib with bigger rooms
And find another way to fill in
That's just the life, that's just the way that we living
Challenge the way of the system, she tryna balance the taste of the liquor
She know that we'll never be us again
She know I'm focused on me as a man
I'll never change, I'm still the same
And that's just something you can never manage
I know you hate how you ain't do no damage on me yea yea

[Bridge: 070 Shake & 070 Phi]
Don't have no time to have you all up on my mind yeah
You always looking and I know I'm hard to find yeah
You know I meant it when I said this shit is mine yeah
Nothing to lose, I got this all up on the line

[Chorus: 070 Shake & 070 Phi]
Saturday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
She do it for the show, I didn't even know
Sunday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
She do it for the show, I didn't even know
Ooh, Sunday night
