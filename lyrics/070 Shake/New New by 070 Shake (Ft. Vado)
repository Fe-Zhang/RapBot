[Intro: Shake]
Yeah (Woo!)
Shake
070
Yeah

[Chorus: Shake]
Don't get satisfied
Livin' the same old life
Don't let a movement die
We just want it all
In a new day
With a new thing
With a mean words
With a new lang
I don't want everything new
In the street new new new new (Yeah)
In my town new new new new
What about you?

[Verse 1: Shake]
I'm always in town with my homie loitering
Until I figured out I had no more tolerance
For the life, at the world, got a bottle
Mama's havin' lot of trouble paying for the rent
So I told her this
In the new day, no more strugglin'
In the new days, I'll accomplish shit
I messed around before but now I'm serious
That's it
I'm in the game, never gonna quit
That's it
If you want a lot of things, get rich
That's it

[Chorus: Shake]
New day
With a new thing
With a mean words
With a new lang
I don't want everything new new new new
In the street new new new new (Yeah)
In my town new new new new
What about you?
Yeah
Don't get satisfied
Livin' the same old life

[Vado]
Yo
'Bout time I set the bar high
Gold watch
Gold [?]
Cooked rocks
Pot's my only hard times
Cold flow
Sniffing these hard lines
Smoke weed by the [?]
Over the casket where your mom cries
Fresh dressed the model
The Ski E A [?] gortex and goggles
After that, I ate
Next step's [?]
Who's in the A?
I'm probably the boy who busts checks with Pablo
I'm done speaking
War, I'm gun reaching
Wipe his blood off the floor then come bleach it
When I stood aside the store, I slung pieces
Dumb sneakers, 2Chainz a hoe, Jesus
Some hate it, but some think it
Drug king could just hit me with some recent
Say "Dude nice" I'm like "Your son decent"
Got a few bars, to me that's some precent
Why talk?
Yes I walk
They made for the street, one deep, my slime fought[?]
Your chick told me you cheap, that's my fault
Shit, what I sport? 8 series, I sport
If you go get it, the rest just roll with it
Used to sit in front of the building like old tenants
Never made a sale in person, that's so different
This chicken, put you in the box with no biscuit

[Outro: Shake]
Don't get satisfied
Livin' the same old life
Don't let a movement die
We just want it all
In a new day
With a new thing
With a mean words
With a new lang
I don't want everything new
In the street new new new new (Yeah)
In my town new new new new
What about you?
