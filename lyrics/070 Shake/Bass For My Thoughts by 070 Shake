[Intro]
No, no, no, this isn't a phase
These thangs ain't no game
The club's only fun with 40s to the face
The face, the face
But say that we make it

[Hook]
Turn up the bass (turn up, turn up, turn up)
The bass, the bass
Turn up the bass (turn up, turn up)
The bass, the bass
Turn up the bass (turn up, turn up, turn up)
The bass, the bass
Turn up the bass
The bass, the bass
Yeah, yeah, louder, ooooooh
Yeah, louder, ooooooh
Yeah, louder, ooooooh
Yeah, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, turn up!

[Verse 1]
Ding, ding, dong, ding on your doorstep
How could you be so shallow?
Some things are so hard to swallow
But I'm still pop, poppin' bottles
Cause it's sunny out, and the money out
So now I got a chance to help Anny out
Super, super
Super, super, super, super, superheroes in the buildin'
Children please stay children
When the money come around they come around
'Member good times, great sounds downtown
When the money come around they come around
'Member good times, great sounds downtown
When the money come around they come around

[Refrain]
Can't believe you're missin' this
I know you wanna witness this
I can't believe you're missin' this
I know you wanna witness this

[Verse 2]
This time I got first
Now I'ma really go berserk
Close the curtain, close the curtain
Cause you don't wanna see me get turnt
Get turnt
I don't feel it, it's the mothafuckin' blessin' and the mothafuckin' curse
And a curse
Cause you can say the truth
You can say it 'til it hurts

[Refrain]
I can't believe you're missin' this
I know you wanna witness this
You know what we started with
And look at what we did with it

[Pre-Hook]
And if you don't want savin' then I'll let you drown
And this ain't how she raised you, she wouldn't be proud
These lessons are dangerous, I can't even explain 'em
These lessons, teacher, can you hear me now?

[Hook]
Turn up the bass (turn up, turn up)
The bass, the bass
Turn up the bass (turn up, turn up)
The bass, the bass
Turn up the bass
The bass, the bass
Turn up the bass
The bass, the bass
Yeah, yeah, louder, ooooooh
Yeah, louder, ooooooh
Yeah, louder, ooooooh
Yeah, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, turn up!

[Bridge]
The bass, turn up, turn up, turn up
When I first got here I started
Turn up, the bass, turn up, turn up, turn up
I thought it was cool
Turn up, the bass, the bass
The bass, the bass
The bass, the
Turn up the bass

[Verse 3]
And if you don't want savin' then I'll let you drown
And this ain't how she raised you, she wouldn't be proud
And if you don't want savin' then I'll let you drown
And this ain't how she raised you, she wouldn't be proud
Rest, rest, rest on the leaves
Death, death, death in front of me
Alien, I'm a myth, baby I'm a beast
If you don't want confrontation I suggest you leave
This a fire, this a noise, baby this my team
Couldn't be a student cause I had to teach
Couldn't use a pen cause I had to lead
Cause I had to lead
Cause I had to lead
They'll kill me if I stay so I gotta leave
More liquor stores than a place to get your groceries
Sellin' cancer sticks but they bug me when I smoke my weed
See I gotta make a difference in society
Death, death, death
In front of me
You don't want none with me
You don't want none with
Death, death, death
In front of me
You don't want none with me
You don't want none with
I can't hear you cause the bass
Say it louder cause the bass
They didn't see this comin', bass
I can't hear you cause the bass
Bass!

[Bridge]
And if I hit you with this bang, you won't feel anything
If I hit you with this bang, stronger gang, gang, thang
If I hit you with this bang, you won't feel anything
If I hit you with this hot beat, yeah

[Outro]
No, no, no, this isn't a phase
These thangs ain't no game
The club's only fun with 40s to the face
The face, the face
Say that we make it
But should I really save her?
You're not supposed to know about this
But should I really save her?
You're not supposed to know about this
You're not supposed to
You're not supposed to know about this
Turn it up! Turn it up!
You're not supposed to know
You're not supposed to
