[Bridge]
We the kids that never made them proud
We the ones that break the rules, we live to stand out
We the ones that never gave a fuck bout how we look, bout how we sound
We never made them proud

[Hook]
Popping, drinking, smoking, yeah
Just to get away from our emotions
Cope with the commotion
Just a couple doses
Just to feel the motion
We the kids, we the trillest, we the dopest

[Verse 1]
I don’t need no one to pat my back
When you start from here you might not even hear a clap
Success could bring the war in, nigga you under attack
I face another, help me face the fucking facts
I could give my all and man they still won’t love me back
Momma please don’t stress
It might not look like much but momma ima be the best
And I’m so destructive so baby please watch your step

[Bridge]
We the kids that never made them proud
We the ones that break the rules, we live to stand out
We the ones that never gave a fuck bout how we look, bout how we sound
We never made them proud

[Hook]
Popping, drinking, smoking, yeah
Just to get away from our emotions
Cope with the commotion
Just a couple doses
Just to feel the motion
We the kids, we the trillest, we the dopest

[Verse 2]
One for the niggas talking shit bout a million you ain’t never making (no, no, no)
Two for the complicated bitches that I left cause I did no choice (no)
Three for myself, on my shit, ima grind so my niggas could rejoice (yeah)
I got a dream in the town with the top down
I got a dream with my town on the top now
Green light homie I can’t really stop now
I don’t hear nothing what you saying, tempers on loud
Scared of the days passing fast
I popped a bar last night and that shit left me on my ass
Who the fuck is that, out of stash, out of stash
Who’s that creeping in the window?
Man I really love the blacka disco
Killing these niggas, turn your wife into a widow
Don’t give them any info
Let them keep creeping in the window

[Bridge]
We the kids that never made them proud
We the ones that break the rules, we live to stand out
We the ones that never gave a fuck bout how we look, bout how we sound
We never made them proud

[Hook]
Popping, drinking, smoking, yeah
Just to get away from our emotions
Cope with the commotion
Just a couple doses
Just to feel the motion
We the kids, we the trillest, we the dopest

[Outro]
I don’t need no one to pat my back
When you start from here you might not even hear a clap
Success could bring the war in, nigga you under attack
I face another, help me face the fucking facts
I could give my all and man they still won’t love me back
Risk it, this for the homies that risk it
This is for the girls that risk it
