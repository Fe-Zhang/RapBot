[Intro]
I'm dreamin'
Ayy

[Verse 1]
Truth be told, I got the hardest ahead, yeah
But I said I'd never let it get to my head
I be in space in a daze while you tellin' me things
I see your face but I never really hear what you say
Red light, green light, either way I'ma go
New place, corner store ain't that close anymore
Yeah, let me get the greens, I'll be home by four
If you wanna pour up, then I need me a four
Yeah, anything less, ain't gon' hit to the core
I mean, anything less, you can leave it at home
I mean, anything less, you can take it to go
I mean, anything less, any-anything less
I mean, anything less, ain't gon' hit to the core
I mean, anything less, you can leave it at home
I mean, anything less, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, daydreamin'
Hey, daydreamin'
Daydreamin', daydreamin'
Daydreamin', -min'
Daydreamin', -min'
(Yeah, uh)

[Verse 2]
More fish in the sea, but see, I don't go fishin', yeah
So if you want it, then you gotta come and get it, yeah
Like my ends, baby girl, we need to split up
She said, "I get crazy when I start to get my drink on"
Ah, told the bitch I wasn't fucked up off the liquor
Where the fuck you goin'?
We go way away for a mini-retreat
We go to space, spaceship, in the back of the seat
I walk around, fuck around while you fuckin' with me
I'm dazin' out when I start to hear the sound of the beat

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, daydreamin'
Hey, daydreamin'
Daydreamin', daydreamin'
Daydreamin', -min'
Daydreamin', -min'
Hey
