[Verse 1]
My mind won't let me rest, voice in my head
I hear what it says, I can't trust a thing
If I picked up and left, how fast would you forget?

[Pre-Chorus]
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothin' bad
This time I won't, this time I won't

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)

[Verse 2]
No, I won't let you stay
Thanks for the hours, thanks for the days
If I see your eyes, I turn to stone
I look away, I gotta go
Gone for the week, don't bother
'Til pigs fly, she'll keep on callin'
I been workin' for me, not sorry
Next time that we speak'll be calmly
Next time that I go in, I'm all in
Why you so close but you feel so far?
You look the moon in the mornin'
Jaded, faded, almost gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Restin' while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothin' bad
Goodnights are never really good nights, nights, nights
Feel something that's heavy inside

[Chorus]
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
Five A.M. when I walked in (Walked in)
Could not believe what I saw, yeah (Saw, yeah)
You were on another one's body (Body)
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me (Haunt me)
I caught you but you never caught me (Caught me)
I was sitting here waiting on karma (Karma)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
There goes my guilty conscience (Conscience)
