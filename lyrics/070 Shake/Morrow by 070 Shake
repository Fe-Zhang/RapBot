[Verse 1]
An early mornin', no clouds up in the sky
She's paranoid, but still she don't know why, yeah
But still she don't know why, yeah
There's fire in ya, I know it burns inside
It's your decision, but still you make it mine, ayy
It makes it easier for ya, ayy

[Chorus]
I know it's hard to swallow
I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow (Yeah)
'Morrow (Yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (Yeah)
'Morrow (Yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Ah, did you not get the message?
Said I'm done callin' and textin'
Don't be so passive-aggressive
You're gonna pass that aggression
We in business, I've been invested
I did not come to impress ya
You're gonna know 'cause it's destined
You feel it in your intestine (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I know it's hard to swallow
I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow (Yeah)
'Morrow (Yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (Yeah)
'Morrow (Yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow

[Bridge]
You can't scream loud enough (No, no, no)
No one's around you (No, no, no)
Heart filled with malice (Oh, oh, oh)
And that's how you'll have it (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm still so proud of you (Oh, oh)
Don't turn your back on me (No, no)
We'll find our balance (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I, only I can control, need to find, to decide
Why I'm alive, in the burn and the glow
'Til I learn how to flow with the highs and the lows
(With the highs and the lows)
Cons and the pros (Yeah, go)

[Chorus]
I know it's hard to swallow
I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow (Yeah)
'Morrow (Yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (Yeah)
'Morrow (Yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow

[Outro]
I'm fuckin' around, oh yeah
I'm fuckin' around, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
