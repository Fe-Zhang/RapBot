[Intro]
Hmm, hmm
When you take the shot, babe
Look me in my eyes before you sip it
When you take this off
I can't even lie, I be lookin'
We could lock it up

[Verse 1]
I be feelin' free in your prison
Something I never had
And then I start to wonder, oh
Something I'll never have
And then I start to wonder
Why can't I feel it with another?
And then I start to wonder
Why can't I see it with another?
Yeah, maybe she's a lockdown lover, oh-oh, oh, hey, yeah
Maybe she's lock down, oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
And I'm screamin', "Fuck sleep"
I'ma need you til' my knees weak
In a week need you terminal B
Need you to hold me, oh-oh
Yeah
And I'm rushing home
(I was hiding inside what I felt, I felt like)
I feel it
I feel, hmm
(This isn't what you see if you-, if you're looking at it [?])

[Verse 2]
I felt this once before
What if she's a lockdown lover?
What if she never leave me for real?
And then I start to wonder
Why can't I feel this with another? Yeah
And yeah, maybe she just wanna be free for the night
But don't you fall in love with my baby
We're all born to die, so really nobody's safe here
I get so long
That your bitch she’s feeling for more
We could all squeeze up in this four-door

[Outro]
I was, I was hopin' to be alone
But I've realized at the time that
That I did it for you
Like I needed you, I needed to talk and you receive it
I wasn’t...it wasn’t perfect, but you see...
I felt this once before
Consider...consider it all
