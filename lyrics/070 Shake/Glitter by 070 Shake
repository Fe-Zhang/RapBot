[Intro]
Sebastian
If this lasts longer than the song or the nightclub, I don't know
It wasn't made for you to swim or you to want to get deep, you're only shallow
Very careless I have been, this sweater ninety-six
That's before my time, before I even exist, before I even exist
Before I even existed, yeah, before I even existed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I want to get rich, did I want to live?
Did I want to bring what I got to the block
To the block like this (This), like this (This), like this (This, this)?
Did I even exist, did I want to live?
Did I want to bring what I got to the block
To the block like this (This, this, this-is-is)?

[Chorus]
And the people that I met make it bigger
And I can promise you I'm doin' better
And I can't leave you much, just this glitter
And I can't leave you much, just this glitter, just this glitter
All over your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body

[Verse]
All the sudden this, all day
That's twenty-four hours outside of the gym
It's been nineteen tears to nineteen years
And now is that you wanna question
How, when, where, and who I have been
This time I don't be losin' my head
Truth is I don't wanna lie again
Truth is I wanna find myself again
Tell me my friend, my friend (Friend-end-end)
When did I lose it? My friend (Friend-end-end)
Tell me my friend, my friend, my friend (Friend-end-end)
When I did lose it, lose it again (Again-gain-gain-gain)?
I've been drinkin' lots to forget about the news (News, news, news)
I know when I sober up I'll have to pay my dues
My friend, my dearest friend (Friend-end-end)
When did I lose it? Ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I want to get rich, did I want to live?
Did I want to bring what I got to the block
To the block like this (This), like this (This), like this (This)?
Did I even exist, did I want to live?
Did I want to bring what I got to the block
To the block like this (This, this, this-is-is-is)?

[Chorus]
And the people that I met make it bigger (Bigger-er-er-er)
And I can promise you I'm doin' better
And I can't leave you much, just this glitter
And I can't leave you much, just this glitter, just this glitter
All over your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body (This glitter)
All around your body

[Outro]
All over, all over your body, all over your body
All over your body, your body
All over your body, your body
My friend-end-end-end, end-end-end, end, end-end-end
Friend-end-end-end, friend-end-end, friend, end-end-end
Friend-end-end-end, end-end-end, end, end-end-end
Friend-end-end-end, friend-end-end, friend, end-end-end, end
