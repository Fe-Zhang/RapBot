Left me like a fish on land
Left me like a fish on land
Left me like a fish on land
Left me like a fish on land
Were just waiting on a friend
You were just waiting on a friend

Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
You don't love me anymore

You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
Shaking to shake your hand

Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
What we gonna do this for
Maybe we should stop now
I don't love you anymore

You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on

Sometimes I get stuck in another moment
It isn't mine, babe, I know I don't own it
But can a young one fantasize on it
Wonder where the truth lies, bet it lies on me
And I bet I got it on me
Metaphorical gun when I'm speaking in tongues
And you know who I am, I ain't the only one shaking
Fish on land
It feels like I just don't belong
But still going 20 years strong
And what the hell been going on
Fish on land

You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
You left me like a fish on land
