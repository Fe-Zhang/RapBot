[Verse 1: Shake070]
Don't play wit me, long as I'm honest
Don't get too close, baby I'm toxic
Need to get the racks and the bread up
Living like a slave and I'm fed up
If my niggas ever low, tell 'em get up
Me and my crew
Know a couple things we could do
You, never satisfied with the truth
You, everything you do is for you
Only really care for a few
Oou, Follow you to the bathroom
No, Quick climb inside the bathroom
Don't worry, I'm right behind you
Don't got no time for distractions
Don't got no time for no acting
You say you working, you lacking
Action action, baby I need action
You're fine with relaxing
Baby, find a passion
Then you'll understand me, oh

[Hook: Shake070]
Uptown got a nigga so throwed
I'll be back soon girl before you even know
We gon' make it but we gotta lay low
Spit fire wit my heart so cold

[Verse 2: Shake070]
I'm just trynna get it wit my real ones
Sip a lil', puff a lil', baby feel some
We don't really give a care if you feel us
This is war baby, only for the killas
Business, baby only for the dealers
So blueprint, if you trynna build us
Lemme see your armor girl, if you trynna shield us, baby
And you don't see the vision
And you don't ever listen
So, I'm gon' make you mess up, ooh

[Hook x2]
Uptown got a nigga so throwed
I'll be back soon girl before you even know
We gon' make it but we gotta lay low
Spit fire but my heart so cold

[Verse 3: Shake070]
You don't really understand, hit the door
Heater crib, but my niggas on the floor
Feel a lil' cool, pop one, took four
Shorty came through, I think I need a lil' more
Act like I don't know
What you did before
When I said just go
You said that for sure
Did your thing but said you weren't ready though
Did me wrong, expecting me to let it go
I said I couldn't make it
And you just get upset
And my niggas they just get it
Drives you crazy cause you let it
And I never get the credit
I already fucking said it
Hurtful words and I regret it
You just tripping cause I meant it
And I don't got the time for this
I'm working on myself and shit
I don't got the energy
Girl I need a line for this
Everything so tight
I don't got time for you to try to fit
Take this and just try a bit
Let it drip, sink it in, get a grip, get it baby, keep on dancing
Bring it low and take it far
Love it baby, find a passion, take it in and love it up
Truth be told, I lied to you
Wrong for me to ignite the blues
We'll take control and light a few
We cannot make it righter, no
Same old thing, with the same old words
Let it out bang, bang
Let it hit, then I skid
Got you rocking with the beat
Can you love me for me
Can you let this be us
Cause my dreams are a must
Just, me and my, me and my

[Hook: Shake070]
Uptown got a nigga so throwed
I'll be back soon girl before you even know
We gon' make it but we gotta lay low
Spit fire and my heart so cold

Uptown got a nigga so low
Uptown

[Outro: Shake070]
There's beauty in the chatter
So baby you whatever
Not really trynna settle
This love thing is a setup
UPTOWN
