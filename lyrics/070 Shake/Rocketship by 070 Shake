[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard the message you relayed, oh woah-woah, woah
Say I always go away, oh woah-woah, woah
Ask how long I'll be this way, oh woah-woah, woah
You don't know if you can wait, oh woah-woah, woah, hm
Baby think it's straight, oh woah-woah, woah, yeah
How long I'll be this way? Mm

[Refrain]
Forever (Say, hm), forever (Yeah)
Forever (Say, hm), forever
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)

[Chorus]
It feel like I'm on a rocket ship, rocket ship
It feel like I'm on a rocket ship, rocket ship
And ain't nobody stoppin' this rocket ship
Ain't nobody stoppin' this rocket ship (How long?)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I leave for a month, couple weeks ain't enough
I can't be here for fun, yeah, you see what that does
I gave you all in one, triple three sum it up
I'm in need for that rush, like the tree need the sun
And there's something 'bout it
Can't have fun without it (No)
Start to form a habit (Woah)
Then become an addict (Uh-uh)
Movin' slow, then increasin' speed
Take it off, now we sittin' free

[Chorus]
It feel like I'm on a rocket ship, rocket ship
It feel like I'm on a rocket ship, rocket ship
And ain't nobody stoppin' this rocket ship
And ain't nobody stoppin' this rocket ship (How long?)

[Refrain]
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)

[Outro]
Can't find the one, I guess I'm better off
Now know it's genuine, I just can't tell at all
I, I, I really wanna have you
I'll be your backing
Right now the moon feels lighter than the sun
Rocket ship, rocket ship
It feel like I'm on a rocket ship, rocket ship
And ain't nobody stoppin' this rocket ship
Right now the moon feels lighter than the sun
Forever (Forever)
Forever (Forever)
