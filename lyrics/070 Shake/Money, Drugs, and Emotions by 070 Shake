Go right by the window
Lookin at the youth
Take it all with you
But you can't take my sins
Oh, what is there to do
In a world filled with money, drugs, and emotions

But you can't take my sins

VERSE 1
Sun shines here a lot
Yeah, and every single time I take a shot
I think bout how you told me I'd never have a shot
But now I'm pourin up
And when I'm in your city i'm a foreigner

So give me foreign love
Take it like a mission
Never give it up
And baby this my mission
I gotta level up
And now you let em get to us

Never let em get to us
And now you let em get to us
Never let em get to us
And now you let em get to us
How you let em get to us

Don't jump, don't jump, tell em don't jump
Don't come, don't come, when I come up
Roll bum, roll bum, make the roll jump
Roll up on scum got the right stuff
Roll up on scum got the right stuff
Got the right stuff
Roll up on scum got the right stuff
Got the right stuff

CHORUS
Money, drugs, and emotions
Money, drugs, and emotions
Money, drugs, and emotions

Take it all with you
But you can't take my sins
Oh, what is there to do
In a world filled with money, drugs, and emotions
Money, drugs, and emotions
Money, drugs, and emotions

VERSE 2
You see her in the sky
With diamonds in her eyes
She watches as I fly
Yeah, she's beggin me to live
She calls me every night
The ocean starts to cry

Yeah oh, cause you won't run with us
We step inside the bus
You should come with us
Yeah, the lie is wearin off
Reality's upon
Color's drippin on
Color's drippin on

If we ain't go through with this
Yeah, what are we gon do with this
If we ain't go through with this
Yeah, get that thing and make it flip
Yeah, all the work inside the wrist
Jealousy inside the head
Envy stuck inside amiss
If we ain't go through with this
Get that thing and make it flip
All the work inside the wrist
Jealousy inside the head
Envy stuck inside amiss

Jealousy inside the head
Envy stuck inside amiss
Inside amiss

CHORUS

But you can't take my sins
Oh, what is there to do
In a world filled with money, drugs, and emotions
Money, drugs, and emotions
