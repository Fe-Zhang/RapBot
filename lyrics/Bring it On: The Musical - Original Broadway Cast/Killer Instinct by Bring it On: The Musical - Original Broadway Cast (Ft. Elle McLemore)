[EVA (ENSEMBLE)]
Dear God up in heaven, a prayer for Campbell
Once she was my hero, now she's a disgrace
I'm here on top and she's less than zero
Dragging me down to save face
She always worked hard, she was trusting and fair
And Lord, that's the crux of her problem right there

You need that killer instinct to give you the nerve
To grab everything you want in life but may not deserve
Like if some girl's in your way, there's only one thing to do
You blackmail your mother, who sits on the school board
To get Campbell transferred and ripped from the life that she knew!
And your dreams come true (Your dreams come true)
And your dreams come true (Your dreams come true)
And your dreams come true (Your dreams come true)
And your dreams come true, oh, oh

It takes that killer instinct, that killer desire (Killer desire!)
Are you the little ant or do you set the ants on fire?
And if there's two girls in line to lead the team before you
Then you hack the school system and change Skylar's grade
From a D to an F then you hire some sick guy
To lick Kyler's toothbrush so she contracts mono
Now no one is left to be Captain so they turn to you!
(They turn to you!)
And your dreams come true
(Dreams come true, they do, yeah yeah)

Do I sound awful? What have I become?
Who's that girl in the mirror I see?
(Who is she? Who is she? Ooh...)
Some backstabbing whack-job I'd run screaming from
Oh God, I just love being me!
Wouldn't all of you kill to be me?!  (Aw shit)

You need that killer instinct since time first began
From Genghis Khan to Bristol Palin, you need a killer plan
You need to reach the top, if it's the last thing you do
I'm the girl to beat, the high school queen
Seniors kiss my ass and I'm just 15
(And soon the world will know her name)
I'm raisin' hell, and I'm a felon in a 4-foot frame
I just use my killer instinct and my dreams (dreams) come (come) true
(Your dreams come true
And your dreams come true
I use my killer instinct)
â€“uuue
(Killer!
Instinct!)
Oh yeah-eah-eah!
