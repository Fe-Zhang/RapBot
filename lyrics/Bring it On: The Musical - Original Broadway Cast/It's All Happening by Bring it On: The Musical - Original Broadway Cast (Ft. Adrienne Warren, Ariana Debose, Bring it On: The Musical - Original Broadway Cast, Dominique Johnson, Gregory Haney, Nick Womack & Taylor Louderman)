[NAUTICA]
Mmm hmm

[LA CIENEGA]
Mmm to the hmm

[DANIELLE]
All right, my subjects
Your attention, please:
Listen up, this is how it's gon' go
We gonna gather up every good girl we know
We'll get vertical ‘til we get vertigo
Let's show these hoes how to put on a show!

[NAUTICA & LA CIENEGA]
We need the very best boys we can find!

[DANIELLE]
They gotta be strong and they gotta be fine
Do what'chu gotta do, wine and dine
But keep this in mind:

Imagine the lights, imagine the people
Imagine us in the middle of the crowd
Imagine the fame, imagine the fortune

[ALL]
It's all happening

[DANIELLE]
Imagine your life and all of the changes
Imagine makin' this neighborhood proud

[NAUTICA]
And they're screaming our names out loud!

[ALL]
It's all happening

[DANIELLE, NAUTICA & LA CIENEGA]
Listen up, this how it's gon' be
We'll qualify in finals then shine on TV

[DANIELLE, NAUTICA, LA CIENEGA & ENSEMBLE GIRLS]
And we are gonna need a new routine
We need some new dudes on our new team

[NAUTICA & LA CIENEGA]
We need the very best boys we can find!

[DANIELLE]
It's gonna be hard and it's gonna take time

[NAUTICA, LA CIENEGA & ENSEMBLE GIRLS]
But if we stay on our grind

[DANIELLE]
The world is gonna—

[DANIELLE, NAUTICA, LA CIENEGA & ENSEMBLE GIRLS]
Watch us shine!

[CAMERON, spoken]
Hell naw!

[RANDALL, spoken]
That is for girls

[TWIG, spoken]
Cheerleading, you say?

(sung)
Okay, so women who wouldn't give me the time of day
Are startin' a squad and they want me to play?
And if I play, I'll be famous?
Gimme a hard one, these are no brainers!
I don't know what these other brothers are thinkin'
They must'a been drinkin', get it and let it sink in!
What are y'all scared? Y'all think cheerin' is feminine?
Then I'm a feminist swimmin' in women, gentleman
Consider it — it's a little different, isn't it?
Your thinking is limited give it a minute envision it—
Dead in the middle of seventy women on television
Every little bit of precision is magnificent!

[DANIELLE, NAUTICA, LA CIENEGA & CAMPBELL]
Imagine the girls!

[TWIG]
What?!

[DANIELLE, NAUTICA, LA CIENEGA & CAMPBELL]
Imagine the action!

[TWIG]
Ha-ha-ha

[DANIELLE]
The only boy in the middle of the crew

[TWIG]
Yeeesss!

[NAUTICA]
Imagine the locker rooms after practices

[TWIG & GUYS]
It's all happening!

[NAUTICA & LA CIENEGA]
The spins and the twirls, the world's reaction

[CAMPBELL]
When they see what Jackson can do

[TWIG]
Fellas, are ya feelin' my point of view?

[ALL, except CAMERON]
It's all happening

[DANIELLE]
C'mon, let's go-o-o-o

[CAMERON, spoken]
No

[DANIELLE & CAMPBELL]
Let's go-o-o-o

[DANIELLE, NAUTICA, LA CIENEGA & CAMPBELL]
Don't say no-o-o-o

[ALL]
Whoa-o-o-o

[NAUTICA (with LA CIENEGA)]
Oh yes!
Me and La Cienega—accept no less
Cruisin' La Cienega, with no stress
Fellas yellin' "ven aca"—speak inglés
You tell 'em, and yes, I'm gonna get much more
Paparazzi always comin' 'round our door
And it doesn't matter what we're famous for
Everything we get is gonna be top drawer!

[DANIELLE]
And our aim is—

[TWIG]
FDR was a cheerleader!

[DANIELLE]
To be famous—

[TWIG]
Paula Abdul was a cheerleader!

[DANIELLE]
Soon the world will know what our name is!

[RANDALL]
Soon you'll be a cheerleader!

[DANIELLE & GIRLS]
Yes, our aim is—

[TWIG]
Yo, Madonna was a cheerleader!

[GIRLS]
To be famous—

[CAMERON]
Yo, I don't wanna be a cheerleader!

[GIRLS]
Soon the world will know our name!

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Michael Jordan was a cheerleader!

[CAMERON, spoken]
Stop lying

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
"Michael Jordan was a member of the Laney High School cheerleading squad for two years before joining the Junior Varsity basketball team." I'm reading this from Wikipedia

[LA CIENEGA, spoken]
So it has to be true!

[CAMERON]
Picture me, wearin' the two-three
Like Jordan wore when he dunked from the free throw line
A legend in his own time
But I'm just a legend in my own mind

[CAMERON & GUYS]
Gimme the ball!

[CAMERON (with GUYS)]
I fall back, I got this!
Drivin' the lane, I'm insane with the hotness
Yes I take it, I rip it,  I flip it
I'm whippin' it around
Double dribblin' without Scottie Pippen

[CAMERON]
And now for somethin' diff'rent
Y'all found this competition
And now
Y'all wanna go buck wild on television
Wow
I'll admit it's not how I envisioned it
But I'll stick with it if y'all stay sizzlin' hot
[GUYS]
Rah!

Rah!

Rah!

Rah rah sis boom!
 
[CAMERON (with GUYS)]
Pop 'n' lock 'til we bop to the top
Ladies! Bring it on if you love hip hop!
And me, I'll grab ya when ya flip and drop
Tell Jordan I'm comin' for his spot!

[ENSEMBLE]
Imagine the lights!

Imagine the people!

Imagine us in the middle
Of the crowd!

Imagine the fame!
Imagine the fortune!

It's all happening!

Imagine your life and
All of the changes!
Imagine making this neighborhood proud!

And they're screaming our names out loud!
It's all happening!
 
(Yeahh!)
Lights!

Imagine!

In the middle of the crowd!


Yeah!



All of the changes


Go Jackson!
Go Jackson!
 

[DANIELLE & CAMPBELL]
And the truth is we can
Do this—
If we start right now and pursue
This—
We'll get through
This—
And we know
This—
So let's go put the
Whole world on notice!
 
[ALL]
It's all happening

It's all happening

It's all happening

It's all happening

Ahh—
 
[DANIELLE]
Who's in?

[NAUTICA & LA CIENEGA]
I'm in!

[COMPANY]
I'm in, I'm in!
I'm in, I'm in!
I'm in, I'm in!
I'm in!

[DANIELLE & CAMPBELL]
We can leave behind the world we—

[ALL]
—know-ow-ow-ow!
Let's go-o-o-o!
Let's go-o-o-o!
Let's go-o-o-o!

 
[GUYS]
Get your hands up!
Woah-oh!

Get your hands up!
