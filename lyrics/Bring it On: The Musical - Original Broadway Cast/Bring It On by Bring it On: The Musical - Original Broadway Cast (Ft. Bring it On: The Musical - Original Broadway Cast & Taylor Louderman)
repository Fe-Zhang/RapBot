[CAMPBELL]
Gone
My one chance to shine
The friends I called mine
The girl the world will never see
More than replaced
It’s like she’s erased the best of me
I have no choice
I’ve got to take back what she stole
Get back my one moment

Made a vow, I was gonna be a cheerleader
Like the Buccaneers in front of me
Now, if only I could find a way
To get back into the Nationals
And make her pay!

[CAMPBELL]
Nautica! La Cienega! Danielle! Jackson?

[COMPANY]
Jackson!
Go Jackson!
Go Jackson!
Go, go, go, Jackson, go!

Oh oh
Let everybody know, Campbell’s back—

[CAMPBELL]
This is my town!
Oh!

[ALL]
Oh! And Eva's going down!

[VOICES]
Eva is like the best—
—coolest—
—sweetest cheer captain...
I'm in love with Eva
Oh my god!

[COMPANY]
Bring it on!
Go!
Bring it on!
Go Campbell!
Bring it on!
Go Campbell, go!

[Instrumental break]

[CAMPBELL]
I'll take first place
And throw it in your face!

[COMPANY]
Rah!

[CAMPBELL]
Think you can beat me?
Go ahead, c'mon!

[COMPANY]
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

[CAMPBELL]
And once I have my squad
You'll feel the wrath of God

[COMPANY]
So let the doubters and the haters and my tears be gone!

[CAMPBELL]
I’m gonna bring it on!

[COMPANY]
My year! My time!

[CAMPBELL]
I'm gonna bring it on!

[COMPANY]
My destiny!
Bring it on—

[CAMPBELL]
Gonna bring it on!
