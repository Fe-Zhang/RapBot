[CAMPBELL]
I was in the stands
Rooting for our team
When I saw the Buccaneers cheer for the first time
Standing on their hands
Every move extreme
I looked around—
Do these people see what I see?
These Truman girls were super-human girls
And when they started to fly, I knew
That I would find a way to be up there one day
'Cause in that moment I finally knew what I was born to do

[ENSEMBLE]
Go, go, go Campbell
Go Campbell, go Campbell
Go, go, go Campbell, go!

[CAMPBELL]
Yeah!
Yeah!

[CAMPBELL (ENSEMBLE)]
Believed I was gonna be a cheerleader like the Buccaneers in front of me
So I stumbled 'til I tumbled then I made the team
Now my life is every adolescent's favorite dream

Slow-motion down the hall (Hey!)
As kids all stop and stare
I feel like I'm a part of it all for the first time
And if I ever fall (No!)
I know my squad is there
'Cause I've got the Buccaneers here behind me

[CAMPBELL & ENSEMBLE]
These Truman girls are super-human girls
And there is nothing that they can't do
(Nothing that they can't do)
And beyond all the squads
They're semi-demigods
And when our powers combine

[ENSEMBLE]
We do what we were born to do
Hey-ey-ey-ey

[SQUAD]
Ready? Okay

[SKYLAR]
My name is Skylar, I rep the Bucks with pride
I'm probably too cool for you so friend request denied

[ENSEMBLE]
Aww

[KYLAR]
I'm Kylar, from Tyler, my real name is Ines
But Skylar said to change it and I do what Skylar says!

[BRIDGET]
My name is Bridget, I rock the parrot head
It's hot in here and kinda smells like someone wet the bed

[ENSEMBLE]
Gross

[STEVEN (with ENSEMBLE)]
What's up? My name is Steven, I'm so handsome it hurts
Don't need an umbrella, I stand under miniskirts

[ENSEMBLE]
What!

[STEVEN (with ENSEMBLE)]
Yeah, I'm a boss, don't care what the haters say
How many dudes can say they pick up girls all day?

(spoken)
Love you

[CAMPBELL, spoken]
Love you more

[GIRL, spoken]
Oh, yay. Cheerleader tryouts are tonight. Pick me

[BOY, spoken]
No, pick me. Even mocking cheerleaders cannot hide the emptiness in my soul

[CAMPBELL, sung]
Hey!
You never met me face-to-face
If you think cheerleaders are a waste of space
We work and we fight and we train and hustle
We get mani-pedis, but we're made of muscle
We got one shot that we work all year for
We got more balls that the team we cheer for
Nationals is getting closer by the minute

[CAMPBELL & ENSEMBLE]
Last year we took bronze, this year we're gonna win it!
Bring it!

Counting down the days (Hey!), making new routines (Ho!)
Trying out a tumbling pass for the first time (Oh-ohh-ohh-ohh)
Calling on a play (Hey!), here behind the scenes (Ho!)

[CAMPBELL & ENSEMBLE]
I look around—
Do these people see what I see? (I see)

These Truman girls are superhuman girls
We've got the spirit and we'll see it through
(We've got the spirit and we'll see it through)
We gladly pay our dues with every sprain and bruise
Because we're doing what we're born to do
(Doing what we're born to do)
(Doing what we're born to do)
(Doing what we're born to do)

[CAMPBELL]
Doing what we're born to do
There is so much more to do

I can see it in my mind, this moment's mine
When we win first place, we'll know how bright we shine
We will move like parts of a finely-tuned design
Not a wasted throw, not a toe across the line
(This moment's mine, this moment's mine)
We will leave it all on the floor

[ALL]
We will leave it all on the floor
(We will leave it all / We will leave it)
(Leave it all / We will leave it)

[CAMPBELL]
'Cause this is why we were born (Go go go)

Oh! There is no second place, you're either flying or falling
Oh! C'mon pick up the pace, I hear destiny calling
Oh! You cannot be afraid to fall down and work through it
Oh! 'Cause this is what I'm born to do, so let's do it
