One half of my conscience says go to church
The other half say stay with my boys and do some dirt
Father God can you please make a way for me
I’ve been in this game too long
And it feel like I cannot go on
Cause you know that my mind is my weakness
Night after night dreamin' I’m dying, leavin' me speachless

[Verse 1]
I’m smoking weed to get high, but I don’t know why
It’s either live for the Lord or prepare to die
My baby mama starting to really run me hot ya’ll
Cause she got another man picture hanging on her wall
I’m tired of living how I’m living cause that hurts my heart
But if I ever lose the Lord then that’s the worstest part
I used to wish upon a star, but I don’ start to pray
Brighter days with the Lord above are on my way
Am I a fool on the cool in this worldly place?
Because I’m walking around with a mad mug on my face
I’m wasting time instead of me trying to be getting on the grind
Losing my mind, cause all I’m thinking about is dope rhymes
I tried my best to bless the North the South the East and West
But I must confess that I be leavin them Johnny’s on they quest
Lord can you bless me, and save me in a hurry
Cause if you don’t, then I’m gonna die from all this worry

[Hook]
I got one foot in the grave (I gots one foot in the grave)

[Verse 2]
It seems like I can’t catch my breath
I hates my birthday, cause I get closer to death
I’m all by myself since my girl left
Staring at the butcher knife, sitting on the kitchen shelf
I shoulda snatched your life when you was near me
Now you be on the run, because you fears me
I can’t believe that you left me lonely
I feels like I’m dying on the phone crying to my homie
He said I need to be strong and just hold on
But my will is weak and my mind is gone
I wonder can I make it through the next minute
I’m seeing visions of a grave, and I’m layin' it!

[Hook]

I tried to quit smoking about a week ago
Now I got insomnia, and I can’t sleep no mo’
Unless I’m taking Tylenol and Nyquill
I can’t be still, cause I’m addicted to them pills
I got a gun to my head about to use it
I need to try to find the Lord before I lose it
I want to go to heaven, but I’m scared
If I kill myself, I’m gonna go to Hell instead
So now I’m in a no win spot
Death is what I’m hollerin' about so follow me on my bloody route
I wanna see my son so I can kiss him
But I don’t wanna let him go cause Lord, daddy gon’ miss him!
I better hurry up and make a choice
I’ve been hurt for the last time, can’t you hear it in my voice?!
I better drop the Glock nine and pray
Cause all I see ahead of me is mushrooms and yellow tape

[Hook]

And so what if I die tonight
I’m going home to heaven, praise the Lord I’m gonna be all right
Cause sometimes I be trying to escape
By takin' a swisher break, So holy spirit give me strength and fate
Lord I know that I can make it
If I just take it, a little slower and have patience
Instead of worryin about the problems I got
And he’s not the father of that baby that she’s got
Snot be runnin out my nose, I ain’t got no clothes
Went from Kangols and polos to t-shirts and afros
I gots no money for a haircut
That’s why I’m walking around lookin like a nut
Pullin' my britches up, thinking that I’m stuck, but I ain’t
Thinking I should quit, when I know that I just can’t
I thank the Lord above cause he’s a saint
He picked me up when I was down and out in the paint
I went from high priced Nikes, to pro wings
But I got Jesus Christ…. So I ain’t worried about a thing

[Hook]
