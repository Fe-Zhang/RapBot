[Verse 1]
Yo, yo
I picture you and me that perfect match baby
Even though I'm a thug, I've been sensed attract lately
I've been feelin that love you've been dealin
Dealin while you be peel and that sexual hail
So holla at your boy momma
For whatever it is you need and greed
Lay your feet on my knees, let daddy rub em in ease
Some that stress that you feelin from hard days at work
That got you ready to brawl out
Ride on the wrong route
Hot days, cut off shorts low and your thongs showin
Tryna find ways to see me without your mom knowin
(Does it matter? I) I ain't up to no good
(She stay just fine) The rest of the thugs in the hood
Sippin thug passion, Rubber band wrappin my cash
And I can't front, Plus this blood my veins pumped
Lames wanna dry they hands
Soon as they get the chance, blow
Ride wit a real nigga I'll show ya how a thug move

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Move just like a thug does
You can't stop, just cuz you love a thug
And he moves just like a thug moves
You can't stop just don't have to
(Repeat once)

[Verse 2]
Now listen if you fishin for sharks you bound to get bit
Ate up and swallowed quick, digested
Pay attention bird, You seem like a money machine
The nigga will probally feed you and give you what he need to
Just to hit it, Ma listen I ain't him
So just forget it I'd rather run wit my chips
Timbalands, Bo-sag and gun on my hip
(That's right) That's right I'm a thug and I love this life
Love my mommas, that gloves thick wit bonnas
Holdin me tight on the back of the Honda
Why I'm liftin it up, Pretty face wit a bad girl personna
And I respect when you save the niner
Instead of givin it up
So if you a queen carry yourself like one
And that's a jewl and some food for thought
The truth it, your money cashes is useless
All my real mommies ride wit me
I'm sittin on double duces

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Move just like a thug does
You can't stop, just cuz you love a thug
And he moves just like a thug moves
You can't stop just don't have to
(Repeat once)

[Verse 3]
It's in my blood to make it hot (Whhhyyy)
Roast it up on the block it won't stop (Whhhy)
Til I get this money, In no time (In no time)
Twirve, crunch the twirve so, holla if you hear me girl
I refuse to dedicate my life to satisfying women
Who don't want to be satisfied
See love I, Can't stop
Gotta keep my thang in motion
That's why I'm double doucin
Ho's coast to coast and
And everything that glitter and ice
It's some mommies will go for food
It's only a chosen few, that'll do that bit wit you
Weekend and trailer visits and live wit you
Say they got you covered
In a minute you hit wit football numbers
They off and runnin
Whatever time you put in wit em was all for nothin
So until I fall I'ma continue to blow
Get this bacon
Like a thug would do it
There ain't nothin to it

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Move just like a thug does
You can't stop, just cuz you love a thug
And he moves just like a thug moves
You can't stop just don't have to
(Repeat once)

[Caddillac Tah Talking]
*Ashanti harmonizing in the background*
Yeah, whats poppin mommi it's Caddy
Holla back
Yeah, you trying to holla at the king?
You trying to run wit the king?
Dig what I'm sayin?
We can do it however you wanna do it
Take it to ya home plate
Yeah, Holla at a thug
You know?
Word, you know, cuz I'm not him
