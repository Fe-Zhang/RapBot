[Verse 1]
It's that pimp, mack, hustla from the "O"
Slangin' that 'dro, I ain't fuckin' with blow
But you can blow, if you a hoe
All the bitches love to taste my sack--of indo
Fuck a Benzo I got me a 'Lac
And a fat-ass Expi on top o' dat
Betta back the fuck up, fool, you can't harm me
It'll take a whole army to fuck with Barney
Bumble, an East Oakland mack
Makin' hella money, I got hoes on the track
You wanna buy a Bumble-sack, come and holla at a pimp
I be that fine muthafucka in the Town with the limp, bitch

[Chorus]
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious

[Verse 2]
You can catch me in the flick "I Got Five On it"
You wanna party with Barney? Bring the gin & tonic
I got the chronic with the most potency
I roll the blunts like they supposed to be
Don't come close to me, unless you got scratch
Ask all of the females in the "O," I eat the snatch
You want a batch of broccoli? I got hella
I'm the pimp with the green umbrella
I sell a hella lot of herb
But you betta know the magic word
I'm on the turf, when you see me holla "What it do?"
Or catch me on "I Got Five On It Too"

[Chorus]
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious

[Verse 3]
(Oh yeah) I got grapes hidden all o-va
You can smell the aroma of the doja
I thought I told ya, bring some dough
Or you ain't gettin' smoked off my Os
This ain't no charity, a hustla gots to eat too
Jimmy, Oscar and Arnie, that's my crew
I thought you knew we only fucks with the real-a
That's why I listen to the Darkroom Familia
I'ma finna keeps on hustlin'
While my bank roll keeps on bubblin'
Bumble servin' buds relentless
Makin' them riches, straight Town business

[Chorus]
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious
Bumblicious, oh so vicious, all the bitches say my sack is delicious

[Outro]
Ye, ye, you know you love that shit
You wanna buy a Bumble-sack?
Come see ya boy, I be in the "O"
"I Got Five On It Too"
