[Verse 1]
I'm writing you this letter just to let you know
Even though through out the years my feeling never showed
You were just a little girl when I fought for mi clicka
I remember times I had no peace of mind
You see I had to hussle cause I couldn't find work
I didn't know that when I left that your feeling were hurt
Daddy please don't go the streets are bad
How could I explain that I had to be a man
Risking all my vida every hour of the day
I always cruise around looking every single way
Just to take you to the park I always said tomorrow but I said that every day
Then I'll kick it in the barrio mija understand daddy only wants the best
The day you were born I knew that I was blessed
Now I'm ready to change
I know it the only way
Let me wipe your tears cause your daddy's here to stay

[Chorus]
I got something that I want to say
Daddy's home and I'm here to stay
No need to cry cause I'm not going away
(I love you daddy) daddy's home and I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
It's the rage of my god please don't take me away
I want to be with my family but I killed a man yesterday
You saw 'em coming up and your face showed fear
Don't take away my daddy and I couldn't wipe your tear
They shoved me in the car mija please don't cry
They were taking away your daddy and you didn't know why
Let me go I'm a man and I wana be free
Found me guilty so they sent me to the crazy penitentiary
Now I never see you cause you hardly ever visit
You had your quincianera and I missed it
To many long years and I couldn't see you grow
You're the only one I love but you didn't even know
I looked through my letters
To make me feel better
I could tell your little tears dried up on the letter
I miss you daddy cause now I'm grown
Times are getting hard when your daddy's never home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry little mija that I chose this route
I didn't realized what this life is all about
I waited for this moment for so long
I don't know how I lasted feeling strong
Now I'm standing by your side and I'm here to stay
I'm never gona let anyone take you away
Forget what I did
Cuz I was never there
Cuz you just got to know that I'll always care
I missed it all your first day at school
Every single birthday man I played a fool
How could I have been so blind
The love I was looking for was their all the time
I see your face and you cry I felt the swelling in my chest run deep inside
Querida your my angel the girl of my dream
Even though in the past I did some crazy things finally daddy's here
To wipe your tears away put your head on my shoulder cause daddy's here to stay

[Chorus]

I'm sorry mija
No need to cry cause I'm not going away
