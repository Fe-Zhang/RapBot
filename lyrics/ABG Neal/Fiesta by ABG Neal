[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Bitch I am a gangster
I play with sticks like a ranger
We put the opps in danger
Spin his block, do something major
Stay around sticks, like I come from the nature
Kickin' the door, my niggas soldiers, they ready for war
I shoot the clip, 'till my fingers is sore (Huh)
All of my enemies poor (Aye)
They know I shoot like Dwayne Wade (Yeah)
We spin his block, like a Beyblade
I see my fiends, and I know it's payday
Shoot through his back, it come out his abdomen
Come through in All Black, like a African
We put that boy to sleep, Raymour & Flanigan
The way I pull up, they freeze like a mannequin
I don't love bitches, I love to sell crack
She try to front me, made her throw it back
You niggas fruits, like a snack
I buy her McDonald's, if she tryna MAC
I need the cheque, Nike
Tryna rob me, is extremely unlikely
That nigga hate me, cause his shorty like me
We drop a opp, then have a fiesta
I got a gun, bitch I ain't no wrestler
Stay around sticks, like a campfire
Got love for my blood, like a vampire
We drop a opp, then have a fiesta
I got a gun, bitch I ain't no wrestler
Stay around sticks, like a campfire
Got love for my blood, like a vampire
