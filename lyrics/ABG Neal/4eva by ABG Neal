[Intro]
*Laughing*
A Lau on the beat

[Chorus]
If I call you my bitch, hope you ridin' forever
Call you my bro, then we dyin' together
If I say I got you then you know I mean it, whenever you need me I'm sliding whenever
Got 30 bands in these joggers
Fucked up these Balenciagas
Come through with sticks, like I play for the Dodgers
I fuck her once, then I gotta dodge her

[Verse]
Nobody believed in us
Fucking his bitch, that was the easiest
Reppin' the gang, then nigga no leavin' us
We got them sticks every time that you seein' us
Come to my block, this shit hot as a fever
And I cut her off, I been dyin' to leave her
Don't understand the shit that I feel
I stay in the field like a wide receiver
I be around killers and goblins
I know that you don't want no problems
My niggas trappin' and robbin'
And me and my Glock is like Batman and Robin, yeah
Step back, get them off me
VVS diamonds come from Avianne
Now all they bitches is on me
Big guns like we come from the army

[Chorus]
If I call you my bitch, hope you ridin' forever
Call you my bro, then we dyin' together
If I say I got you then you know I mean it, whenever you need me I'm sliding whenever
Got 30 bands in these joggers
Fucked up these Balenciagas
Come through with sticks, like I play for the Dodgers
I fuck her once, then I gotta dodge her
