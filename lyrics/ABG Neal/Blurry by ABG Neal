[Intro]
A Lau on the beat
Hey, Tony!
Huh? Ryte, gangsta
Let's get it on, huh?

[Chorus]
All the opps, they bums and dirty (Huh?)
All of my guns hold 30 (Yeah)
See me out that window, you better be worried (Bew, bew)
We spin they block, 'till my vision get blurry
I burn a bridge, then I get to swimmin' (Huh?)
I never trusted these women (Ryte)
You got a gun, but who is you killin'?
Heat up his block, if we catch him chillin'
All the opps, they bums and dirty (Huh?)
All of my guns hold 30 (Yeah)
See me out that window, you better be worried (Bew, bew)
We spin they block, 'till my vision get blurry
I burn a bridge, then I get to swimmin' (Huh?)
I never trusted these women (Ryte)
You got a gun, but who is you killin'?
Heat up his block, if we catch him chillin'

[Verse]
I seen the cops, I drive to the maximum (Skrt, skrt)
My pants keep fallin', cause I got them racks in 'em (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I don't know a fiend, and you know I'm taxin' 'em (We gon' taxin' 'em?)
You drive down my block, we shoot up his Maxima (Doot, doot, doot-doot, doot)
Pull up in All Black, I look like I'm Batman (Look like I'm what? Look like I'm what?)
We spin through his block, and turn it to Baghdad (Iraq, Iraq, Iraq)
Police on my body, I watch for the undies (Watch out, watch out, watch out)
On that block, had the Glock in my undies (It's on me, it's on me)
I'm whippin' a pot, beat it (Beat it)
She don't wanna fuck, but she gotta beat it
That bitch is buggin', if she think I'll eat it
Toast up his block, heat it (Huh?)
I made a hunnid bands, in these Amiris (Bew, bew)
We spun so much blocks, can't even see clearly (Huh? Ryte)

[Chorus]
All the opps, they bums and dirty (Huh?)
All of my guns hold 30 (Yeah)
See me out that window, you better be worried (Bew, bew)
We spin they block, 'till my vision get blurry
I burn a bridge, then I get to swimmin' (Huh?)
I never trusted these women (Ryte)
You got a gun, but who is you killin'?
Heat up his block, if we catch him chillin'
All the opps, they bums and dirty (Huh?)
All of my guns hold 30 (Yeah)
See me out that window, you better be worried (Bew, bew)
We spin they block, 'till my vision get blurry
I burn a bridge, then I get to swimmin' (Huh?)
I never trusted these women (Ryte)
You got a gun, but who is you killin'?
Heat up his block, if we catch him chillin' (Gangsta)
