[Intro]
Huh? Right, on blood nem
Huh, let's get it on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
Shawty wanna go through my texts, she buggin' (Huh)
You know I delete it
Never have I met a bitch in this world that I needed
She talkin' 'bout, "She wanna leave"
Cause she get mistreated (Huh)
With a big gun, is how they get greeted
You spin on my block, then you get defeated
And if you come back, that shit get repeated
Bullet hole so big, you can't get it treated
Huh, right, yeah, I seen a opp, then I got excited
Beat up the pussy, it look like I fight it
Free all the felons, that done got indicted
If you need work, then I could provide it
Get out the trap, you was never invited
Huh? Right? When you catch you a opp, it feel like a home run (Damn)
All the fiends on my block always askin' to hold some
When you get locked up, bet that you told some
I need my money in whole sum (Huh?)
On that Bixty-8 block, I was hustlin'
We fucking hoes by the dozen
I got them tools, like construction
Spin they block, you know we causin' destruction
I'm the big homie, I give 'em instructions (Gangsta)
I shoot the clip, 'till it's empty
Where was you at, when my stomach was empty?
How many duffels I got? Plenty
I hate them bitches, that's always too friendly
Free all the felons, I read all the letters they sent me
Most of them niggas, they doin' like twenty
I hit me a lick, then fuck up the G-spot
They say he tough, but we know that he not
He say he get money, but he wear a G-Shock
I hope that my junkies don't ever get detoxed
