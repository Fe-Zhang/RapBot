[Intro]
Huh? Ryte, gangsta!
All my shooters foreign
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's get it on
Huh, huh

[Chorus]
Who's that at the door knockin'?
I don't wanna fuck, I just want the noggin
On the block jugging and robbing
I came from the bottom so she started toppin'
I turn her family home to a crackhouse
I'm not talking titties but I bring them racks out
Ain't no McDonald's but I bring the Mac's out
Don't wanna wrestle, this shit ain't' no smackdown
Who's that at the door knockin'?
I don't wanna fuck, I just want the noggin
On the block jugging and robbing
I came from the bottom so she started toppin'
I turn her family home to a crackhouse
I'm not talking titties but I bring them racks out
Ain't no McDonald's but I bring the Mac's out
Don't wanna wrestle, this shit ain't' no smackdown

[Verse]
I stay with the stick like a pimp
Too much guap in my pocket, I walk with a limp
That nigga food, shrimp
All the fiends that come to me getting skimped
Yeah how many bitches I got? Several
My block is hot, devil
I need the top, mental
We been at war for so long need a medal
We turn that boy to a skeleton
Pull up in all black, melanin
That bitch a bird, pelican
Who's that at the door?
Boy you better not let 'em in
I turn a good mother to a crackhead
My hundreds all blue, they be yelling "What's crackin'"
We make a movie if he with that acting

[Chorus]
Who's that at the door knockin'?
I don't wanna fuck, I just want the noggin
On the block jugging and robbing
I came from the bottom so she started toppin'
I turn her family home to a crackhouse
I'm not talking titties but I bring them racks out
Ain't no McDonald's but I bring the Mac's out
Don't wanna wrestle, this shit ain't' no smackdown
Who's that at the door knockin'?
I don't wanna fuck, I just want the noggin
On the block jugging and robbing
I came from the bottom so she started toppin'
I turn her family home to a crackhouse
I'm not talking titties but I bring them racks out
Ain't no McDonald's but I bring the Mac's out
Don't wanna wrestle, this shit ain't' no smackdown
