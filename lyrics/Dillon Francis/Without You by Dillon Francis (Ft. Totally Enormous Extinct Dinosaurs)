You can hold on if you want to
But you know I'm gonna let you go
Ain't nobody there to talk to
Nobody's at home in this heart my dear
If only you could see the bright side
Of waking up and being alone
If only you could see the future is all yours now
Cause I know I'll be higher without you now

Keeping I will last somehow
Oh, you be light without me
Feeling alright somehow
I'll be high without you now
Keeping I will last somehow
Oh, you be light without me
Feeling alright somehow

Cause I know I'll be alright without you
High on my own
You'll be high without me
High on your own

Higher without you now
Keeping I will last somehow
Oh, you be light without me girl
Feeling alright somehow
I'll be high without you now
Keeping I will last somehow
Oh, you be light without me girl
Feeling alright somehow
Feeling alright somehow
Feeling alright somehow

You can hold on if you want to
But you know I'm gonna let you go
Ain't nobody there to talk to
Nobody's at home and this
Heart might deform you
You can see the bright side
Of waking up and being alone
If only you could see the future is
So yours now
