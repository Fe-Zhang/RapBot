[Verse 1]
Pressure everyday by the same old thang
Niggas thinking that they hard, niggas claiming a gang
Barely reaching age 20 in the '93
And waking up every morning to live through just a day
Watching for my jack, watching my back
Watching for my crack with the sight and the tec that I pack
I got homies on my side but I really don't know
Cause them same trick niggas be fighting over hoes
Say they down with Coop but the condition is critical
But I can't deal with niggas if your thoughts not identical
I hold on my own, not even looking for help
Cause a nigga like Coop is getting down for oneself
Never trusting a nigga, and never trusting a bitch
Cause a nigga ain't shit, and a bitch is to hit
And every night I close my eyes, then I pray
And check up on my mama to be sure she's okay
I'm hoping that the next day my mama will awake
Please spare her life Lord, cause mine's here to take
And will I see the stars or will I see the bars?
Another young black society in scars

[Hook]
For life under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
Under pressure
Like this

[Verse 2]
Way past ten, I can't cope with my life
A daytime player but a thief of the night
I'm true to the game, always kept the mentality
Had to pack a strap just for the fear in me
And now it's on my side 20 years where they stood
I dedicated life to the street of my hood
And back in '87 no control of my mind
I'm hanging on the cuts with a sack full of dimes
Had to keep my business on the earn like a G
And ain't nobody know a damn thing about me
Greatly influenced by my homie Rust
The only nigga in the hood that had a nigga's trust
In the battlefield of my city streets
Where only the strong survive, and the weak shall sleep
With the feel of war on the skin of me
A black player considered the enemy

[Hook]
Damn, pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
Under pressure

[Verse 3]
I had nowhere to run, with nowhere to hide
A player to the upmost hail by my pride
I got another stripe in the year '92
No good to be slipping, cause I had a few
Draped in black spitting game like a pharaoh
Making to this bitch that had to be they ho
And now they're trying to play on this player like a mark
And yelling they hood can hit me up in the dark
A nigga from the metro, so they all stare
Hometown crew had let they timples flare
And just 20 sail cook ass for the gin
Now some nigga put a test on that fool's chin
As I looked up, I saw em heading my direction
I squeezed a trigger and hit the mid-section
Pressured by his peers, and couldn't see the light
He had me under pressure, so I took his life

[Hook]
Damn, under pressure
Under pressure
More pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
