And let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
I'll slay all suckers from state to state
Or should i say city to city coming face to face
Brothers case the place but we're going to take this cake

Only one first place runners a get ran
Fuckin up your man, trying to duck these hands
Up rockin' sure shotin' flip it up with cap
All your homeboys is biters, now what's up with that?
B-boys done did it since dr. Spot
Don't believe that's my main man Dr. Rock?
Before the Glocks go pop we body rock on the block
Back spin pop lock cops lock the spot
See, this is no fable this is real life
Props to Popmaster Fable and his chill wife
We understand the love.  They're getting all praise due
But still I, drop props to the cool phase 2!
Amaze you stays true old school brand new!
Daze you!  Blaze you!  Battle no can do!
I'd Advise you try they have about 9 lifes
You shook jooks!  Title took, what you look surprized?

You see the smoke so you know there's fire
New all nat album hip-hop empire
They too, insignificant, just too, magnificant
To rip it prolific and watch you wicked as you whippin' em
He beat your ass like cancer fags is flashdancers
Gone ain't got a chance, it's on
You just romance these stones that I grip and pose
Like ambrose shell toes some hit 'cha bawws! (huh)
You're getting played punk, digged your own grave chump
See new strenght move by my brother brave monk
Monkey see, beat masters so they give fly props
But me I owe a lot to the one shot rock and reg not them there
Was like fred astaire make moves for your lady baby stop and stare
You did not prepared your routines is weak old basic footwork with them two left feet
I fresh freeze... now take a fake my man and catch deez... heavy dick in my hand
Ever ready rock steady know your real from fake so the poppers pop, and the breakers break

Now let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
I slay all suckers from state to state
Should i say city to city coming face to face from
That's where the poppers pop, and the breakers break

So let the the poppers pop, and the breakers break
I slay all suckers from state to state
Should i say city to city coming face to face from
Where the poppers pop, and the, and the breakers break
