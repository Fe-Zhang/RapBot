[Intro: The Tonic]
Ok we need to say some things to order the day
Um, Roll call
Earthquake, Ambassador, Tonic, Tru-Life, The Phanatik, Cruz Cordero, Enoch
A'ight
Gentlemen the floor's open
Make yourselves clear

[Verse 1: The Tonic]
Ain't no stopping us
Cause what be coming out our esophagus
Will knock the dust-off a living sarcophagus
Dead men walking, stalking
In the darkness they be hawking
Looking for those home alone like Macaulay Culkin
But when they come knocking
The door be opened by my Pops
Who says, "Come correct or catch the flaming hots"
He gives two choices to those that never heard it
Either be deserted or come and get converted
Even the introverted, in His presence, ain't shy
But scream Jesus Christ equals Elohim and the Most High
Why got to Hell when you die
When Christ be giving fresh breath of life like Binaca
Why be infernally nasty and mean
When you can be eternally crispy and clean
And listen to the God who says
"Forget what you heard
You rep for Me, I'll rep for you, and that's my Word, bang!"

[Verse 2: Tru-Life]
Present and accounted for
Pound it down for my Lord
Sound the horn, spit the raw
Everybody hit the floor!
If the Lord of all
Has given all for all
Then why do most of all choose to ball
And walk the broad?
Livin' for the minute
You think, blink it's gone
We in the clutch now
What now? Kid, come on
Everything we do has a fee
That means it has a cost
Tru-Life says, "Choose Christ
'Cause Christ chose the cross."

[Verse 3: Enoch]
Gospel activist
Advocates
Of salvation, preparing
For the invasion of Christ
The Body-snatcher
Who is soon to come rapture us
A Kodak moment won't capture this
Miraculous event
Our final call is repentance
No moon, no star, no crescents
We give reverence
To the presence of the Maker of the heavens and the Earth
Who places first
Who can match the worth of the great I AM?
Who blows on man and turns him back into sand?
God's Lamb, the God-Man
With the hard hand
Turns to ruin
The wicked and subdues them
Rescues them who pursues Him
Renews them
Who's tuned into the communion
Of the tri-union
It's no illusion, it's the Most High ruling
God and human
Jesus, no man can stand next to
To whom all respect's due
All hail Ixous

[Chorus]
Mics, we blaze 'em
The lost, God will save 'em
Hands y'all, raise 'em
Christ, all praise Him
No pretending
There's only one Savior we're recommending
Indeed, now let's proceed with the representing
Mics, we blaze 'em
The lost, God will save 'em
Hands y'all, raise 'em
Christ, all praise Him
No pretending
There's only one Savior we're recommending
Indeed, now let's proceed with the representing

[Verse 4: The Ambassador]
News flash, it's the Ambassador
Known for askin' ya
Do you know the Master of the world, the One that's after ya
Had His Son to die just to provide a blood bath for ya
You do the math and you come up with love (That's just his character)
He figured the love would capture ya
Cause it's spectacular
He's comin' back like remakes of Dracula
Just to rapture the
Church, I clap because I know Satan's hating the fact that you're
Hearing of Jesus, and the wonderful plan He has for ya
Some might laugh at ya
But they're headed for the wrath that ya
Can't grasp cause you're a passenger
On a path where ya
Party like a bachelor
Max like a Maxima
Play the "mac" in fact ya
Coined the phrase, "Girl, let me rap to you"
You're always strapped down
Got enemies all over Crack-town
I know the haps now
I've got a similar background
Surrender kids, trust Christ, become a friend of His
And let Him throw you on a team of representatives

[Verse 5: Phanatik]
Jesus be the Lord of land and man
He loves ya!
Rejecting Christ is lethal like weapons
In the hands of Danny Glover
Any other option burning in ya chest
That has yet to stop sin from turning into death
Needs to be thoroughly questioned before the firing squad
For claiming to have knowledge that's higher than God's
And for telling people these lives my Dad rented never had limits
Producing a world of bad tenants

[Verse 6: Cruz Cordero]
I rush the
Urban habitats where heads be strapping gats
Rappin' that, "Keep it real," when they're really lackin' facts
About the Action Pack
Attraction that's never slacking, Black
He has everlasting stats on the map
Check the atlas
I attack this
Phat track wit tactics that
Come from the theocratic palace, like Alice
I wonder in this land
If you heads understand
How the blunder of man
Put you beneath the Thunderhand
That won't slumber, Fam
To sling you like a rubber band
Down into hell for rejecting the Son, the Lamb
The eternal Son who was sent
Supreme first-born who took the worst form of punishment
Death was performed the curtain tore it was published in
The holy Handbook
That this man took
For the commission
Of His coming attractions
Of Gospel blockbusters blasting
His Word that be sharper than box cutters

[Chorus]
Mics, we blaze 'em
The lost, God will save 'em
Hands y'all, raise 'em
Christ, all praise Him
No pretending
There's only one Savior we're recommending
Indeed, now let's proceed with the representing
Mics, we blaze 'em
The lost, God will save 'em
Hands y'all, raise 'em
Christ, all praise Him
No pretending
There's only one Savior we're recommending
Indeed, now let's proceed with the representing

[Outro: The Tonic]
Hey, great job gentlemen, we're gonna shut down the house for the day
Go back to your constituents, get your things straight
But that was great representation today
I'm sure uh-uh-umm, ya know
