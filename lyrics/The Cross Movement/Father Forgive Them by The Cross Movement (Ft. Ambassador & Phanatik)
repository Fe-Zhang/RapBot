HOOK: Father forgive them / for they know not what they do / Father forgive them / for they know not what they do / For disregarding what is true / Lovin' sin instead of You / Father forgive them / for they know not what they do

VERSE 1: (Ambassador) Heaven presents another smash hit for Jesus / He keeps you rockin' when we're droppin' phat masterpieces / We're on the side of the God who's been rejected / The One who took flesh, died, but who's resurrected / Jesus the full Godhead manifested / Grace and peace to all those chose and elected, check it / But on the real things aren't chill as they seem (Why) / Cash seems to make mad people blaspheme / That's what the ill deed that man's greed leads to / It's got you bitin' that hand that feeds you / He's grieved to the heart, bone and the marrow / All because God gets more respect from the sparrow / Jesus died for men, but who wants to live with Him? / Can't stand Him, they want the mammon, the Benjamins / And if it's men, then it's within / The natural whim to live a life of unrestricted sin / Huh, sounds fun, but like a hand and a gun / Sin and death go together like Sanford and Son / So this plan is done, it's not hard to hear squads / Talk hard and live like they don't fear God / Plus we're in the era of the Human Superstar, but no matter who they are they fall, tryin' to pull a coup d'etat / Answer me, how can this be sensible? Man tryin' to overthrow God the Invincible / Learn this principle that I'm droppin' / God's omnipotent, omnipresent / He's omniscient and sovereign / That's the first lesson now in this session from my crew / We need forgiveness, we know not what we do

HOOK 2: Father forgive them, for they know not what they do / Father forgive them, for they know not what they do / For puffin' blunts and pullin' stunts and drinkin' brew / For the, criminal acts, done by, criminal crews

VERSE 2: (Phanatik) I'm more than fascinated by the facets of creation and nature / I'm infatuated by the facts and attributes of my Creator / I wager, this world don't even know His name / And those who do, they treat it like growin' pains and go insane when it's mentioned / Feel the tension, between God and man / I ride the land, and see there's 'nuff work to be done between the earth and the One who made it / Everything belongs to Him, so we give props through songs and hymns just like David / But once again the sons of men have formed a pact / Another culture without God is on the map / Lord I apologize for all the guys / Who go one way when You clearly say otherwise / Father forgive them, for they don't know Your plan / Who can stop Your motion or even slow Your hand? / No one can / But still this world they want to have a face off / With the soon coming King, who's runnin' things, like a racehorse / They pace off ten steps, turn and shoot / Haven't even learned the route, and to boot / Swearin' they can make it straight to God / But wait the odds, are stacked up against the man / Whose back is against the God whose hand rules the land / But Ah! What a relief to have my plan reversed / No longer am I down with planet earth where man is first / The actual fact was, I was born with the natural knack cuz / To put God in the back and that's backwards / Truthfully, I now belong exclusively / To the club where God is, no longer where He used to be / Stop the mutiny, save the eulogy / Christ ain't dead my nocka, He's livin' / I often prayâ€”Father forgive them, for they know not what they do

VERSE 3: (Ambassador) You wanna please the Judge, please Jesus, cause He's it / That's most definite, I represent like I believe it / Jesus be the Savior of every man, true dat / Our sinned killed Him once, kill Him again, we'll never do that / We're the crew that sticks to facts from God's Word like glue traps / Peep the fly tunes that bring the Triune Crew back / If you lack Christ, you lack the realistic picture / Your view's tainted / Now let's repaint it with the Scripture / So mentally, you'll vibe with the first century / Begin to see Christ who gave His life to save men for free / You'll see the chains of sin, and the key / The pains of sin and the fee / The names of you, and of me / And the whole Adam family / Taking turns bangin' in, nails and thorns / You'll see our sin that was hangin' Him / You'll see Him raised and see the state of modern history / You'll see the hate for God and wonder how this could be / But this to me is no mystery cause it's true / We need forgiveness, we know not what we do

BRIDGE: Cheating on taxes / For corporate crimes and malpractice / Thieving for excess / For even worshipping the Lexus / For the life of sin and being proud of it / For shifty politics / For teaching ten year olds to pack gats with the hollow tips / For the bragging, the Godless rapping, the kidnapping / Shooting and stabbing / For riding Satan's bandwagon / Father forgive them, for they know not what they do / Father forgive them, for they know not what they do / For trashing up Your planet, breaking every commandment, taking Your grace for granted, living life unlike You planned it

OUTRO: How can this be? / On Your earth yet we have no worth cause we're separated / Look at us making moves / Runaway trains on our own tracks / Only You can bring us back / Thank You Lord for Jesus Christ who came after us / Not like some wicked slavemaster coming to get a runaway slave / More like a loving Father coming to get His runaway children / Forgive us Lord / We all took part / Thank You Lord
