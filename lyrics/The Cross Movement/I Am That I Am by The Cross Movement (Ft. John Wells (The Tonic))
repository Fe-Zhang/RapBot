[Verse 1]
Without the ala-kazam
God said that I AM
Because God is
Without the show biz
Ain't no magic in His linguistics
He is the definition of existence
God is before any thing was
And God did before anyone does
From Alpha to Omega
Without the Boom
Shaker
Had it going on long before He allowed Sega
Or Winnebago
Will take you on a long tour
He got much more
Than you could ever ex-plore
Infinite
Omnipitent
Without descent
Say what He mean, mean what He meant
The Monumentous
Mr. Advantageous
So Magnifico
And yet Solo
Uno
Oh no did this mess up the photo
In your God portfolio
Prepare for the Polo(roid)
Cause you know
And I know
And others do also
God is displaying and saying what?
I AM that I AM

[Hook]
Forever past
I AM that I AM
Forever present
I AM that I AM
Forever future
I AM that I AM
The Great I AM that I AM that I AM

[Verse 2]
In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with God
And the Word was God
And God is still large
Though some find Him strange
He can't exchange or rearrange
And He sure can't change
Makes Hisself known
Makes Hisself heard
Makes Hisself seen
All through the Word
Sometimes a lot, a little
Sometimes in a riddle
Sometimes when He's revealing
It's hard like peanut brittle
But He'll break it down into bite-size pieces
With a complete thesis
That we can eat up like
Reese's peanut butter cup
So good to the roof of your mouth
It'll get stuck
So you can savor the flavor forever
To keep your spirit strong
And your intellect clever
Pull the lever
On all the things you think you know
Shed the dead leaves so you can
Grow and sow and reap and expand
Humble yourself under the mighty hand
Of the One that's saying I AM

[Bridge]
He's Omnipresent
To the..
Up, Down
Left, Right
Broad, Day
Light, Door
Way, Truth
Life
Father
Spirit
Jesus Christ

[Verse 3]
Is back on the scene
Forever existing
Almighty
Supreme
The Theme Who
Came to earth
Through a supernatural
Birth to
Give the worthless
Some worth the
Pharisees
And the Sadducees
Always tried to catch Him up in a freeze
But please
How could they do this
Catch the
Super-califrag-expiali-
Smooth-ness
Everytime they would try to judge
He would step up to beat down the grudge
He said you know your father Abraham
Rejoiced to
See My day
They said hey!
How do you know the father Abraham?
You're not even 50 years old my man
He said verily, verily understand
Before Abraham was...
