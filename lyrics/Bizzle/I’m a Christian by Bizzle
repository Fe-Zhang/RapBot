[Hook]
Homie, I'm a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
And I don't care what you think about it ('Bout it)
On my life, ain't none of y'all realer than Christ
You better read about it ('Bout it), read about it, hey!
And, let 'em know if you a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
Be about it, don't speak about it ('Bout it)
He gave His life, so you ain't have to pay that price
You better think about it ('Bout it), think about it, hey!

[Verse 1]
Uh
When I was in my sin, every song was about it ('Bout it)
And, ain't nobody find nuthin' wrong with my topics (Nope)
Now, I'm with The Lord and everything I'm on is about it
Now, they wanna alter my content, I'm all for that nonsense
Prayed up, serving till my days up (Yeah)
And I'm laid up in the grave in my gray tux (Uh)
Praise to The Savior for grace that He gave us
I'm done getting paid off of crazy behavior
Now, I got my faith high, waiting for the day I
Can have 'em all falling at the cross, like A.I
And, when it get's hard, I'mma praise through the chaos (Yep)
To spit dope that I overdose most canines (Yeah!)

[Hook]
Homie, I'm a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
And I don't care what you think about it ('Bout it)
On my life, ain't none of y'all realer than Christ
You better read about it ('Bout it), read about it, hey!
And, let 'em know if you a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
Be about it, don't speak about it ('Bout it)
He gave His life, so you ain't have to pay that price

[Verse 2]
Living for The Most High, feeling like I won't die
'Fore I get to meet him, I'mma see Him crack the whole sky
Everything He teaching me, I'm speaking through the flow, now
And, it's even sweeter than before now
Got me yelling "God Over Money" (Yeah!), "Christ over fame" ([?])
He the same, even before they added likes to my name (Name)
The fame make you not realize you a slave
Be obedient yo' master, add ice to yo' chains (Uh)
Christ be the key, though (Yes!), your life is the keyhole (Ah)
You were blind to your pride, tied to your ego (Yep)
If life was a movie, would Christ get the lead role?
Or just some insignificant slide in your B-roll? (Huh?)

[Hook]
Homie, I'm a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
And I don't care what you think about it ('Bout it)
On my life, ain't none of y'all realer than Christ

[Verse 3]
See, I claim to be a Christian and I'm true to that
Your favorite rapper claimed he strapped, but, never packed a tool, in fact
I know some Christian cats that never rap it, and they do be strapped
But, they don't flash it for the cameras, nor do they approve of that (Uh)
Real recognize real, who are you? Where you be at? ([?])
I don't gotta stunt, to my son, I'm the coolest Dad (Yeah)
You ain't hard, pimp (Pimp), you just Clark Kent (What you mean?)
You jump in the booth and become Superman (Ooh!)
And, it ain't just fake thugs, it's fake christians (Yep)
If you don't walk your faith out, then you ain't Christian (Yeah)
I went to church for years and ain't live it
Now, I walk close with Him, and, yeah, I know the difference

[Hook]
Homie, I'm a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
And I don't care what you think about it ('Bout it)
On my life, ain't none of y'all realer than Christ
You better read about it ('Bout it), read about it, hey!
And, let 'em know if you a Christian (Christian), a real one (A real one)
Be about it, don't speak about it ('Bout it)
