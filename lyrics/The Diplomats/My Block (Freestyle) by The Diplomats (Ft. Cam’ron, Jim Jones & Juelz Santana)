[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Yo, my homie Cash, well he gone for five
Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
'Cause, we live life to the fullest
300 and 65 nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Now, uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, the morning's much colder
I seen summers get cold
And playa's do it up until the point and that they done and they fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten up north sitting just like some effin' lost kittens
They getting locked up for carrying boy
They doing time up in Marion, boy, uh
I respect you
You do your time like Gotti and come home like that Marion boy
Dipset holla

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
It's Santana, get ready
December
Woah, messin' with the gangstas, riders, uh uh
Y'all messin with some gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Y'all still want beef then holla
You think you 'bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
Young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons
Cocaine lessons to supply the towers, I had
'Fore they crashed and divide the towers
I'm hurtin', working hard to reprovide the towers
Told you, you messin' with a gangsta boy
You messin with some gangstas, boy, don't do that
You got coke, don't move that
These blocks belong to us, homie remember I told you that
As for your boys, it's no more messages
If I see 'em pumping, I'm steppin' in my weapons and
I'm shooting off to the death of 'em
If he try to run shots ahead of him, he's already done and tell 'em (tell 'em)
Welcome to New York City (uh ohh)
No, welcome to Dipset City (holla)
And thanks to Cam, I'm Harlem's new anchorman
Yes, chump, you should shake my hand
'Cause the coup√© gon' make me too cocky
And I'm not gon' wanna talk to you dudes who move sloppy
So move, watch me, stand still don't move, watch me
I'ma show you how to do this, yeah
Uh

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
I'ma break it down real quick, yo
Ayo, look dog I bought villas, stayed in resorts, scrilla
How extort Killa? I extort killas
Man I caught killas, disarmed, fought killas
Cat frontin'?: pop pop, poor killas
Who more realer? Weed in the four wheeler
Eff Mike, till you see me you never saw 'Thriller'
Fishscale, fishscale, gorillas
Dirty whore want me to go, raw will ya'?
Smart Pisces fresh from the Archdiocese
You got heart, fight me, I dearly depart wifey
I'm Anfernee, I do things the harder way
Pardon me, Escalade, marmalade, mama stayed
And I send her where stars'll play
And I do cop a car today, color pink Chardonnay
And I clap at ya' man
Got the clappers, clap on clap off, clap at his hands
Only thing he ever clapped was his hands
He'll get butt-raped, duct-taped, the Michelin man, bastard
Get in this van, listen to Cam, maggot
Get in this van, listen to Cam, maggot
Listen, let's bring it back, you know why?
'Cause, this is the year when cats get shipped in the van
Vision's my scam, listen to man, listen
I miss the era of the BM's, BB's
I was ducking GMDC
Had that scope, aim and I light ya'
Seen all islands, Caymans to Rikers
Contain, detain, maintain, complain the stay [?] reign, the game is for lifers
I don't care I put flame in the fire
Christian, atheist you pray to Elijah
Don't play, okay, just pray I don't snipe ya'
'Cause with the SK, doggy I'm OK
My AK was my a.k.a. before my ABC's had me A-OK
I'll show you how to make 2 million out ya' deal
For the right price, I could get you out ya' deal
Smack ya' CEO, that's when the TEC is soarin'
Four mil' from Def Jam and I ain't sell a record for 'em
