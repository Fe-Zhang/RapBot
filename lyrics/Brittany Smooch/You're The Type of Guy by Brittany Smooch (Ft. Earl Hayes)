Song: You're The Type of Guy



Hook
You’re the type of guy that I like to hang with
Ride around town and act like were famous
You’re a bad boy I think that your dangerous
And that’s the type of guy that I like to hang with

(Earl Hayes)
So you ain’t gotta say to much girl
Cause I already know your type type type
I suggest that you buckle up baby
And get ready for a hell of a ride

Verse 1
Ain't nothing like the feeling that you getting when you chilling with the best baby that what I is
Im way to advanced I ain't gotta go to class
I ain't nothing like the rest of these kids
Im something more exotic, bionic I think im ready for ya
And id give you a sample but I just don’t think im ready for it
Whos hot wait a minute its me
Imma lock the door baby you can be the key
Got the party poppin everybody in here chilling
And that boy in love with me is to scared to admit it
Uh, he blowing kisses so there’s nothing left to talk about
Meet me on the floor we can two step it and walk it out
Im the leader all you gotta do it follow
You can bet your bottom dollar that there ain't nobody hotter

Bridge
But damn boy where you going
Im wondering if I could
Go the same place your going
I really, really think I should

Hook
Cause You’re the type of guy that I like to hang with
Ride around town and act like were famous
You’re a bad boy I think that your dangerous
And that’s the type of guy that I like to hang with

Verse 2
How you doing baby welcome to the cool crowd
The party is over we at the crib and the pool now
Too hot for ya don’t think im ever gonna cool down
And I just took over the world what to do now?
Say goodbye to the babysitter we don’t need a chaperone
Im a superstar showtime when the cameras on
And youre the type of dude I could get in the mood with
Ain't to other readon to be shy I do this

Bridge
But damn boy where you going
Im wondering if I could
Go the same place your going
I really, really think I should
