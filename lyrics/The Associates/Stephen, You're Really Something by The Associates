Stephen, you're still really something
England has its certain nerve and
Stephen, I'll tell you something
Stephen, let's bring down the curtains

A lonely love god
You must take it hard
We're coming, sweet stuff
Well, well, we're nothing but trouble

Well, Stephen
You're still really something

Stephen, electric lady
Stephen, oh, she ain't my baby
Stephen, I was once anorexic
Stephen, I'm a reborn skeptic

Oh, curse and coerces
Is why it so hurts
And these amateur hours
Those tears to this power

Stephen, you're still really something

If I'm going down, I'll pull you down with me
If I'm locked away, send me poetry
Would I be more entrancing if I prove that he's mine
We still get this urge to be Valentine

Oh, Stephen
Turning it even
Stephen
No need for treason

Stephen, what's on the jukebox?
Stephen, enough with the fraud talk
Stephen, I thought I'd just mention
Oh, Stephen, I resent your recension

Did you take a laugh
And then hold me back
It's a lump in your throat
From that and it's grown

Oh, Stephen
You're still really something

And if I'm going down, I'll pull you down with me
If I'm locked away, send me poetry
Would I be more attractive if I prove that he's mine
Well, I still get this urge to be Valentine

Oh, Stephen, you're still really something
Oh, Stephen, you're still really something

Whoa

Did you take a round
And then hold me back
That's a lump in your throat
That I can't disclose

Stephen, you're still really something
Ooh Stephen, you're still really something
Stephen, you're still really something
Oh Stephen, you're still really something
Ooh Stephen, you're still really something
