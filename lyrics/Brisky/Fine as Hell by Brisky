(This how you really get your dougie on right here man)

(aye..whoa..aye..whoa..aye..whoa..aye)

Hello My Darlin, how do you do?
Hello My Darlin, it's so nice to meet you..tonight

(Verse)

Uhh, that dress with your back out, damn that make me black out
Killer when you walk, more dangerous than a trap house
Swag like an actress, but too pretty to act out
I'm here with my niggas, she with girlfriend in the black blouse
Coincidently, we both in parties of two
I think it's only right that we party with you
I see you cross the room looking like you need a groom
Ya body's a banger girl, I'm trying to be who you shoot
At like Gmail, you that type female
The type of girl that can bring the shore to the seashells
And I ain't playin, I might end up your man
If you keep it up like a bra without bands
I'm a black star like the tats are on your hand
You look like you a star, therefore I am a fan
Front and center at your show, trying to touch your hand
Tonight I'm trying to kick it with your band

(Chorus)

From over there you look good
From here you look great
(lil mama you cookin)
Can I get a plate?
I can tell you got taste
Them shoes ain't from the states
Got a lot of ass, but not a lot of waist
Baby you're Fine As Hell
Fine As Hell
Darlin you're Fine As Hell
Fine As Hell

Hello My Darlin, how do you do?
Hello My Darlin, it's so nice to meet you..tonight

(Verse)

Look, them lower back dimples, make a nigga act simple
You control the pace and I'ma keep with that tempo
You up in here looking like the models in the window
Amazing how your skin so smooth like Eddie Winslow
Complimented by that sexy ass laugh
Them sexy ass heels, show off them sexy ass calfs
Don't know if you have school, but hell yes you have class
She know that dress small, she don't let that ass spaz
(Oh No)
Way too on point to let it come up
20 nails done up, hair back down front up
Wearing accessories, Forever 21 rung up
I must say Darlin, you are a stunna

(Chorus)

From over there you look good
From here you look great
(lil mama you cookin)
Can a nigga get a plate?
I can tell you got taste
Them shoes ain't from the states
Got a lot of ass, but not a lot of waist
Baby you're Fine As Hell
Fine As Hell
(You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine)
Darlin you're Fine As Hell
Fine As Hell
(You're fine, you're fine, you're fine as hell)

(Verse)

Mama I swear the way them breast sit, gon get you arrested
The way that dress fit, deserves a toast, Texas
Bellybutton diamonds, same ones that's in her necklace
I'm head over heels for how you build, Tetris
I knew that you was sexy, with a whole lot of S's
Across the room standing by the guy with the guest list
Looking gooder then a tall glass of nesquik
Swagger saying 'Nigga I am not the one to mess with'
You finer than bottles of wine from the twenties
Act sadity, it's ok cause you're just that pretty
With a waist that skinny and a ass fat plenty
Like you say in them clothing stores, 'Pass that to me'

My Darlin
(you looking good)
You put together quite well
(you put togther quite well)
Yea, I say hello my darlin
If you're doing how you look, then girl you doin fine as hell

(Chorus)

From over there you look good
From here you look great
(lil mama you cookin)
Can I get a plate?
I can tell you got taste
Them shoes ain't from the states
Got a lot of ass, but not a lot of waist
Baby you're Fine As Hell
Fine As Hell
(You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine)
Darlin you're Fine As Hell
Fine As Hell
(You're fine, you're fine, you're fine as hell)

(aye..whoa..aye..whoa..aye..whoa..aye)
