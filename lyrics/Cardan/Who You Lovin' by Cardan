Verse 1:
How could I ever make you see the light, and make you read it right
Money power respect nigga, thas the key to life
But see its costy, me I'm to bossy, put four sugars in my coffee
I'm fuckin' wit Mister Frostee
Now thas the run to make ya, See how much fun that'll make  ya
Next time you see yourself, you should see that undertaker
And all the pain is gone, no more cryin', no more stress
Please, give this Ice to Big, and tell him that he's still the best
Fuck it lets have a feast, Go ahead murder the chief
These niggas rappin' back and forth don't know what beef is
Until they need about two gats to sleep wit, A bomb in they Jeep
Know they know who to beef wit
Them fingaz you use to smoke get knocked in your teeth wit
I bet you next time a nigga know who to creep wit
See its no longer funny now, Nigguz is hungry now
You don't believe in Harlem, Double up and get money now

It's like four in the morning, I got a call from upstate

Heart out his chest and, place it on his kneck for him

See I need 40 Acres and 40 Breakers
Ten nigguz that role the dice and twenty shakers

See my man he post bail, but his money was low
I got about eighty for sale and twenty to blow
You see this shit kinda get hectic when you dealin' wit doe
Cuz once you dealin' wit doe, Know You dealin' wit doe
No you not dealin' wit somethin' you can role up and smoke
Hold one side of your nose to a dollar and hope
That maybe one day you could put down the drugs and gun play
Skatin' donw the runway and praisin' God on Sunday
Rhyme to it, Eat a bowl of Courage
Finaly do it, bout time you meet your maker, Body forward in bombing fluid
Now tell me where you run to, no where to run to
Feelin' like nobody wit you, or nobody love you
Meenwhile, Streets is watchin' and the hood is observin'
Clubs still rockin', drunk drivin', weed still burnin'
Now who you lovin', Why you fussin', Who you wanna be huggin'
Role wit nigguz that be thuggin', Gun in the air bussin'
