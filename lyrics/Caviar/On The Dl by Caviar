College girls from Texas
Poly-drug exes, can we make the next-es?
Teach you what sex is
What do you say? Perhaps
I do believe she's laying traps
I've been in So-ho with no dough
And No-Doze and new clothes
The snow blows
Will you kiss me on my tippy toes?]
How's the cash go?
Sixty to zero, gone in nothing flat, alright
[phone rings]
'Hey, it's me.'
Oh, hey there
'How's it going out there? Are you having fun?'
Nah, it's real mellow
Chorus
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
We'll never say a word
And she'll never know, she'll never know
IQ,??
You want rent it, only then never phone
You said your name was Sonya?
'No, it's Jackie!'
Shit, sorry
At the cash machines you started acting selacious
All bumping, grinding and I'm all 'Oh, Goodness gracious!'
Can the security cameras see our faces?
No? Cool
[phone rings]
Hey, what's happening? Leave a message at the beep
'Are you ever coming home? I miss you...'
Chorus
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
We'll never say a word
And she'll never know, she'll never know
Oo, I don't know what she'll say when she hears of it
Oo, I don't' know what she'll do when she knows, when she knows
Chorus
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
We'll never say a word
And she'll never know, she'll never know
Chorus
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
We'll never say a word
And she'll never know, she'll never know
Chorus
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
Whoa, keep it on the down-low
We'll never say a word
And she'll never know, she'll never know
(3x)
She'll never know...
