Is she looking straight at me or is it my imagination
Some kind of illusion or prestidigitation
I cross the room to a standing ovation
A hesitation at my sudden invitation
I'll be an engine tug your caboose, two legs hypotenuse
Come on baby put me to use, don't vamoose

Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over

The smell of the lawn makes you flop down on it
The summertime car has the top down on it
Damn genuine girl pulling sinister tricks
She's American as 3.1416, hand on my throttle
Leave the city behind, there's not a lot in the bottle
Not a lot on my mind

Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over, away

You are my personal miracle, I fell for all of your charms
I worship you like an eastern goddess, the one with all the arms
Little problems in this world but none of them are mine
Whisper me your life story, baby yes, yes we're killing time

Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over, away
Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over
