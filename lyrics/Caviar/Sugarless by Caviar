Attempt the keyhole how
I don't trust for free
All to stop moving now
You taught it all to me
But I can never walk out
I can never walk out

I'm getting down

I'm going out
I have a date with a pretty ballerina
I had a date with a pretty ballerina
How did you get in my bed
I didn't sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down on my nuts to a crawl I'm being primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless

Kasabi courdarouy
How can you refuse
Pissed out on engine noise
Telepathic blues
You know I never lose
Never ever lose

I'm getting down

I'm going out
I have a date with a pretty ballerina
How did you get in my bed
I didn't sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down on my nuts to a crawl I'm being primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless
How did you get in my bed
I didn't sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down on my nuts to a crawl I'm being primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless

I had a date with a pretty ballerina
I had a date with a pretty ballerina
How did you get in my bed
I didn't sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down on my nuts to a crawl I'm being primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless
How did you get in my bed
I didn't sleep with you
Crushed cause I tripped the alarms
I'm going sugarless
Down on my nuts to a crawl I'm being primitive
Out of my head on the prowl
I'm going sugarless
