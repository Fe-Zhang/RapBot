Every body wanna know were I come from
Blocks I stand on most of ya run from
From the bottoms to the top
*I* dare ya roll through da bottoms *in a* drop
104 10th ave *(woodworth)* Its were my love for the *wood was* birth down tha street from *Morning* side
Were many die Even my cousin all he was doin was huslin Right on Inglewood ave
Highly fightin shootin hoops and writin
20 minutes from Long beach 10 minutes from south central My nigga *Gumby* be sellin hoe's out tha rental
Fly then a mouthfucka right by the airport
30 pair air ones Inglewood sports
Im on marget street by tha swap meat still sellin kush were tha cops meet




Tha city of champions birth *the* flow
Tha city of angels birth of coasts
I embrace them both with open arms
Yes Im a playa and Yes Im armed
I took what I learned off these Inglewood streets
*and* put *it* over reflex beats
Now look what I have
Ima a little nice but stay hood like the ave's
Im coming through clear *a* paths
Tha pride and joys of hustlas hope
A gangsta wish a dream for a bitch
I can't let my city down
Cause even before rappin, Niggas was still down
Wat up relative all from the I
*211 deez* G love lets ride
Mack 10 set it off way back then
Now damani in this mothafucka I came to win
