[Hook]
So many people
Are hurt inside
Don't even know Him
Even though they might have heard of God
Can He love me?
Will He hear my prayer?
Or think I'm ugly
When He see's my clothes and sees my hair
I heard of a Savior
Heard He bled and died
And we can give Him our sins
And we can get His life
Yet I wonder for me
If He will He even care
When He sees my clothes
Or when He sees my hair

[Verse 1]
Let me get up in this verse right now
I'm thinking back to when we first got down
I only groped but when You searched I found
Snatched quick
Though You knew how I acted
That's what's sick
I was a pick that You drafted
A backflip with a split
Couldn't be more backwards
In fact
That's classic
I love to see Your tactics
But I think back
To when I'd shrink back
On the real B
It's real deep
I really thought You
Could never feel me
Cause my shirts were double-X
When really I was a small
Double shirts for the effect
When really it wasn't called for
Pants baggie, they sagged
And dragged on the floor
But I was never that boy
To show the back of his draws
But I did hang
Kicked slang
Me and my boys did
Rocked doo-rags
Till it put a crease in our foreheads
And on the surface
Others said we were worthless
But I'm glad You purposed to love us
And You made us Your purchase

[Verse 2]
I was convinced of Your power
So I was down to comply with Your standard
You're God the Father, Creator
I was Your product
But I noticed my focus it wasn't on You
My hope was You would
Meet me in heaven
But as for earth
I'd roll with the hood (I)
Really didn't want Your heaven
Just didn't want Hell more (I)
Really didn't want Your presence
Just didn't want Hell more
I didn't know You were beautiful
You made advances
But in fact
I pushed You back
Like a cuticle (I know)
I was a bad date
But now I know what it was
You got lumped in with some people like a crab cake
They elevate their own (they celebrate)
They make their own what's right
They say it's what You like
Everything else they make it wrong
I'm glad You don't hate our music or fashion
Unless these things and how You intend us to use em are clashing
Cause for us
This is just a part of the culture
But it's the reason why some think they shouldn't try to approach Ya

[Bridge] x2
Man sees the outside
But God sees the inside
No matter your outside
Through faith He'll come inside

[Verse 3]
I could weep
So many people never heard of the name
Yeah they heard the word Jesus
But never heard of His fame
They feel cut off from Him
Not just cause of their sin
But because of their clothes
Hair or their
Color of skin
And they been afloat
Drowning in sin
We're in a Boat
Yet they've never been approached
Cause we see em as different folks
God's offer's universal (yeah)
He wants you in His circle (yeah)
He wants you in a doo-rag
And He wants you in the purple (hair)
Now you can just take a cursory
Glance at the word and see
God made the plans of diversity (now)
Is there one godly ethnic group
In the church
Should we all wear
One polyester suit (or)
Maybe rock
Sandals and robes
No ham I suppose
When we meet
Maybe we should only eat
Salmon and loaves
Should we only like the organ or the violin?
I'm inquiring
I admire men
Up in the choir
And women
But one minute
Why do some people assume that
God's iPod
Got no tunes
That got the boom-bap
He's with White
With Black
With Lat
With Asian
With Rock
Country, Jazz
With Rap
