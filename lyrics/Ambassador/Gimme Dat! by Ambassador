[Intro]
Am-ba!
Gimme dat Fire (Fire)
Gimme dat Flame (Flame)
Gimme dat (x3)
Ab-solutely
You can gimme dat
Gimme dat (x2)
Verse one

[Verse One]
Gimme dat Bible
Gimme dat mic
I'll drop Jesus-centered weight
So we can make a disciple
Can't surpass Christ
There's no taking His title
A passion for Christ
Will have you praying for revival
Gimme my city yeah
Gimme dat
Let's fish
Gospel of peace
Yeah you can gimme dat
Fresh kicks
Gimme dat rest with Your blessing
Lord I'm desperate
You gave me Your light
So I look forward to my exit
I used to be a punk kid
Used to want to run with
Dudes who want to hunt
And turn our ones into hundreds
Used to want a blunt
To be blunt
I wanted trees
Just to alter my mind
Now I find I'm wanting Jesus
Used to want to roll mad deep with a street clique
Want to hold a heat on the low like a secret
God's Spirit penetrated my soul on a sneak tip
Took control
Now I'm in His fold like a leaflet

[Hook]
Gimme dat Fire
Gimme dat Flame
Gimme dat Fresh Wind
Gimme dat Rain
Gimme dat Freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God
Who can give me all things

[Verse Two]
I know you got riches
I know you got ice
Your life is a big party
You're partying all night
You don't mind not knowing Christ
In your mind that's alright
You might not get this now
But you're kind of a Saul type
You keep with the trends
Cool's your middle name
On your pants you got a chain
That droops like lil' Wayne
You're tattooed in a Benz
Maybe you're in a Range
Ladies you drive 'em crazy
Nothing's crazier than your frame
This is a shame
It's the age and I'm game
To be an agent of change
In an age
It's like a page in a flame
Just smoke just mirrors
Just vapor it's plain
To see a holy God
Is not one of your favorite things
I was just like you
But God moved on a fellow
Gave me Good News
That I could use on the ghetto
Maybe it's you
Who wants to U-turn to settle
Your debt if you do
I tell you it's been settled

[Verse 3]
So you got platinum?
We got our Lord
If we want we could ask Him
But He's our Reward
Gotta be perfect
It can't be three out of four
If you're sick of falling short
Then He got a cure
Gimme dat Cure
Dat Door dat Hero
Gimme dat grace
To never chase the dinero
How much glory
Should you give your boy?
Zero
That would cause beef with the Lamb
Like a gyro
Gimme dat day we choose You over shining
Truth over rhyming
Virtue over diamonds
Gimme some change
Sometimes I do need the dough
And gimme some pain
Something I do need to grow
Gimme what I won't ask for
Don't gimme what I seek
When I creep I'm a sheep
Gimme dope pasture
Gimme life
Just like You intended
And sight to see You raised
Like the day You ascended
