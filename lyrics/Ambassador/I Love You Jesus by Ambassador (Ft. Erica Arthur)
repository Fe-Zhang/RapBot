[Intro]
Yeah a smooth joint right here
I dedicate this one to You Lord
Your Ambassador

[Verse 1]
Satan is the choice of the majority
Jesus seems to be the choice of only the minority
But He's the Ultimate Authority
We call it Sovereignty
The most Preeminent
So He got the most Seniority
People follow me
Without restraint
Who knows how hard the heart'll be
The world, flesh and devil
Formed a three-man camaraderie
And my block could be proof
So can Anthropology
Sin has long since become
Man's hottest commodity
Everything from robbery to sodomy
To improperly getting cash
To girls who flash like photography
Without properly
Understanding biblical prophecy
You can't possibly
See where the stop will be

[Hook] x2
I love you Jesus
Yes I do
Love you Jesus
Yes it's true

[Verse 2]
Meet the God who died for me
Enduring all the verbal mockery
Got to be cause He loved me
Like women love a shopping spree
His Agape be the love that got to me
He adopted me
Now I'm in His family and I'm God's property
And periodically
Some youth will want to copy me
As I copy the Savior
So no more living sloppily
And when I start to get wobbly
God will be
Mercy and Grace
The ultimate team like cheese and broccoli
They make up for what we lack
Cause of our poverty
Fills in the gaps and the cracks up in our pottery
I believe I'ma die for sure not probably
(Or you can get rap-tured)
You right
Possibly
But I'ma share my Philosophy
Logically
I know I don't want Hell
Jalapenos are too hot for me
If it's not for free and salvation's got a fee
Then I can't stand it
I'm like Titanic out to sea
Sure to be abandoned like bad stocks will be
But no need cause Christ hit the jackpot for me

[Verse 3]
You know the world
She's my ex-girl
She keeps calling me
Cause we used to go together
Kind of like your cars and keys
I was a fool
But we were cool as an autumn breeze
Til I met the God that parted seas
Pardon me
I had some bad rap and R&B
Ought to be considered as dangerous as clogged arteries
The flesh and Spirit's been warring like dogs and fleas
The God in me
Told me He's attacking all disease
It's getting hard for me
To ignore the spiritual part of me
That wants to hear Christ
And not just lyrical artistry
I want to please the One who stretched out His arms for me
Though I failed Him
He let them nail Him on a tree
By now you're probably on to me
I think the Son's hot
Hotter than high noon summer street corners be
To the only God who gave a Son cause He wanted me
To Him
All the praise
All the glory
And the honor be
