[Hook]
Wasn't a fancy car
Wasn't a diamond ring
Wasn't friends or lovers
At the end of the day
Cause this life's hard
And it can bring trouble
In the midst of this trouble
No one can take it away
You need
His favor (x4)
It was
His favor (x4)

[Verse 1]
I'm a witness
So I'm taking a stand
Life and trouble go together like
Bacon and pans
There's gon' be some up and downs
Like I'm shaking your hand
And everybody gets down
Just like a snake in the sand
But God's faithful to man
He got favor
His hand
Could take a lame
With no cane
Make him able to stand
Man
He can reach inside of us
With a deposit
And got us up outta pits
Reach you at the bottom
Even when bottom is bottomless
I was just there
I'm a product
My survival is
Not cause I'm the fittest
But my God is a Revivalist
That's just
What He is
That's just
What He does
Recognize what it isn't
Recognize what it was

[Verse 2]
Of course it was His favor
How else you get that job?
You ain't have the paper
It's favor
That helped you get that ride
With your credit?
Forget it
How else you get that crib?
Single parent
Apparently
Jesus helped you with them kids
How'd you go from child of wrath
To a child of God
I know the math
I know how to add
Favor multiplied
Grace came out His hands and feet
Grace came out His side
So amazing
So I praise Him
I realize
I was born in sin
But born again
Like I was born on
U.S. soil
Not from K.C
But through grace see
A dude that's royal
Such an unlikely pick
I'm like Susan Boyle
And there's enough grace unlike
U.S. oil

[Verse 3]
Favor is
Grace to live
Grace to die
Grace to give
At the pinnacle is when God came
And placed a bridge
Between Himself
And we who are on the outside
We were lepers
We were desperate
Like all them housewives
It supplies strength
And it supplied need
It's free
Constantly flowing
Like an I.V
Enough for everybody
Even in India
Arie
Up on the daily
Daily He's with me
Like I.D
I was once on top
Thought I was hot to death
Then I dropped
And I brought this
All on myself
Then His grace came down
Gave me life for death
After the swap
Now I'm back
On top of the shelf

[Outro]
Now you prepared my table
You did all the labor
I don't even worry cause
I know that You are able
You even blessed my neighbor
He didn't even have TV
But now he has cable
