[Intro]
We confess
Jesus is Lord from East to West
Don't need a piece or vest to have peace and rest

[Verse 1]
There goes the bell
Well it's on
Word is bond
Now I'm ripping it
Filling cups up with Living Water
Got you sipping it
I be the one that serves you dinner from the Scripture
You may or may not be a sucker but I'm gonna get ya
Hit ya with the word of God that's how we rock the nation
You hear it
And catch the Spirit of intoxication
Drunk in the Spirit's how my whole crew puts it
Look at us walk the straight and narrow and avoid the crooked
Rough and tough
Without the afro puff
It's the supernatural stuff
All about His blood
Like we're Dracula
With spectacular
Spiritual vernacular
Like the concept of the hypostatic union coming smack-atcha
I know it's deep and when you peep you'll find it's dense
Jesus both God and Man
Two-hundred percents
Toss it
Nah we take the Good News and floss it
So the world thinks we drink or mentally we've lost it
It's not that in fact it's just the opposite
We're dropping it
Fully cognisant
He rules
Ain't no stopping it
So like a vulture we swarm on your head
The Holy Culture
Who be dropping bombs on your head
We're glad when
Pagans
Label us
As madmen
Cause we're
The will be's for the Christ
Not has beens
Life's no joke
So even if you fight hard
You'll drown in your sin
If you don't meet Christ the Lifeguard
You kick a different stroke like Willis and Arnold
In warfare you'll be stepping but your weapon won't be carnal
But of course it's
Divine to pull down a fortress
Repaint the picture of Christ to make Him gorgeous
The Lord just
Rocks me
Hah what can I say
Sin
That's a price a rapper can't pay

[Chorus]
The Lord is my Shepherd and I shall not want (right)
He gave me life so I'ma stay on point (right)
I got the Spirit so I don't get drunk (right)
We pumping Jesus in your trunk (that's right)

[Verse 2]
Man is used to seeing Jesus in His Lambness
But they don't understand this Lamb is running every single planet
More than just a Man
This is more than just a Lamb that's dying
From Zion
Behold the resurrected King
The Lion
Check the Majesty
Bad as He is
We happily
Go down to the ground
Without being forced to by gravity
We're glad to be
Prostrate
Bowed down
Is my state
Without pape's
I'm still
Richer than milk chocolate
You can ask the Jews about the power of YHWH
And if He gets busy like a rush hour highway
So much so
They'll have a feast in a moment
From the Unleavened Bread
To the Feast of Atonement
Amazing
Check out the flag that we're raising
Man enough to be caught standing up praising
Jesus the I Am
Cause my Man's
Creation
Should all be giving up a standing ovation
