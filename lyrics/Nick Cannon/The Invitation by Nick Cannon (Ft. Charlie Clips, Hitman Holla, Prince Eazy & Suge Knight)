[Intro: Suge Knight]
—Number will be monitored and recorded
Check this out, uh, Eminem, whatever your name is, right
You know, I don't never do no talkin', but Nick is family
This is your invitation (Hitmaka, D-Diego)
To prove to everybody else what you're about (Go Grizz)
Winner takes all (Right Now Sound)
Eminem's a bitch

[Chorus]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
Ain't no comin' back, that's a fact, this the invitation
Told Joe to lean back, don't get hit with this retaliation
I fuck with Crack, but the white boy he fuck with crack (Crack)
Pills and smack, Shady 'bout to relapse
Call Kim, somebody get Hailie
And that other kid you raisin', that ain't even your baby (Daddy)
Took a page out of Drake book, this might get a GRAMMY
We goin' back to back 'til you respond, on the family
My baby mama killed you off a decade ago
You're still cryin' about it, bitch, now who really the ho?
I called Joe to set you up and you fell for the job
Slim won't show for the video 'cause he terrified of my squad
I heard your chauffeur got a video of you suckin' a cock
You paid him off, then laid him off, now who really the opp?
Suge called me the new Pac, I ain't no killer but don't push me
How the fuck y'all got me battlin' Elvis Pussly? Nigga

[Chorus: Hitman Holla]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand (Yeah)
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last (Incredible game)
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Verse 2: Hitman Holla]
This gotta be karma 'cause he's shit out of luck
Eminem the perfect name, 'cause this nigga a nut
You used to beef with Nickelodeon Nick
He called Hit and I come with the mop and get on my custodian shit
Like bada-boom, dotted beam, llama sing
Got spazzed, put Eminem in the bag, it's Halloween
This ain't an 8 Mile battle, man, I'll do you awful
My competition in the target, I think it's Marshall, holla

[Chorus: Charlie Clips]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand (Facts)
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last (Haha, incredible, I got it)
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Verse 3: Charlie Clips & Nick Cannon]
Come on Nick, that's Marshall, you don't need help
Nigga, you a rider? No safety, fuck a seatbelt
What? Is he out of his mind? I got a Glock
And don't Eminem belong on the side of a nine? That's crazy
Man, you act like Nick hurtin' your dreams
You an M&M, how you mad a star burst on the scene? (Haha, you get that?)
Let me find out you still in that trailer park, this how we do
Run up and shoot the trailer (Blaow), this the preview, Clips, nigga

[Chorus: Prince Eazy]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last (I am)
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back (Eazy)

[Verse 4: Prince Eazy]
He ain't really for the culture
Fucked his baby mama in a choker (Choker)
Picked her up like a chauffeur (Skrrt)
On that Twitter wall like a poster (Ugh)
On foenem she'll get cracked like cocaine mixed with soda
When I take her soul, if the bitch die, I'ma still eat her, I'm a vulture
Why Mariah name in your mouth?
You forty-seven chasin' clout
"Obsessed" came out in '08 and you just puttin' some out? (Damn)
'Cause Marshall think he a ape, but a white boy with a backpack
I do this shit for my real niggas, not the white boys tryna act black, on God (Eazy)

[Chorus]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Outro: Suge Knight]
It-it-it's time to sick that ol' buster-ass, motherfucker
But the shit you gotta realize you run that shit out there, man
And at the end of the day, you got every person in the industry and every person in the streets
Shit, where he gon' go? He just the new Vanilla Ice
'Cause it's a matter of time he hangin', right?
Eminem's a bitch for bringin' bullshit up that's not true
Say some shit and then when shit get a little hot, everybody wanna fall back
Or they wanna run around with all these police
You know, that ain't part-you gon' be a rapper
Any time you're a rapper, you shouldn't have a whole bunch of police badges around you
Any time you be a rapper, you're supposed to be able to meet up with motherfuckers and handle your business
But all we gotta do is get that motherfucker in the ring with you and you're gonna beat the dog shit out of him
That motherfuckin' simple
Nick Cannon is a force in it-itself
And if you have proper time for conversation, y'all got the same energy for doin' stuff for the people
He not scared to do stuff for the people
So if this dude want a real target on his back, that's on him
But don't talk no shit and go and hide
And you know what you call a man who ain't gon' stand up and fight? He's a bitch
We should tell the motherfuckers in Detroit he got twenty-four hours to respond or they need kick his ass out that mothafuckin' city
Hahahahaha, haha
You have sixty seconds remaining
