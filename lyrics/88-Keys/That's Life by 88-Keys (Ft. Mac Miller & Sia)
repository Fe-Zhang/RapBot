[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
They told me, "Don't make a promise you can't keep
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family?"
Man, man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smoking weed, 'causing trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything; I guess we even now
Nothing better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, "Why the long face?"
How I spent 350 dollars on this entr√©e?
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, find forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton (Haha)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange
Sometimes, yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, and I'm headed to the
Other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standing ovation?
A hunnid naked bitches in my dressing room waiting
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm getting high, making love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feeling fucked over so much
Always coming up short, you like the roach of a blunt, yeah
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck paying bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doing wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange
Sometimes, yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu

[Bridge: Sia]
Now, I wish I could take all your pain
But when the toxin is fame
The drugs, they don't fill the hole, no
Connections the game
Wish you'd picked up the phone
Knew that I'd be your home, knew that you weren't alone
Knew that you weren't alone, knew that you weren't alone

[Outro: Sia]
I saw you act a little bit strange sometimes
You'd say:
"Yeah, everybody lives and everybody dies
One day"
Well, that's right
Whatchu gonna do?
But I wish
You could have spent it on the truth
