[Who's the reason for my daddy's grin?]

At first glance
(chemical reaction)
Didn't even say a word
(mutual attraction)
Baby-makin' hips, ain't gon' trip
Rocking raw for months now
(you can call me pull-out master)
But if by chance I come to short
(you could say it was predestined)
Since we started out at 30 years
On day 1
(step into the here and after)
Mmmmm...
(babies making babies making)

[Who's the reason for my daddy's grin?]
The answer
[It's true]
Your momma
[It's true]
Brings the drama
[It's true]
Then she got me
[It's true]
Cause I'm your father
[Suffers even when it's you to blame]

I hear she has a child
(people say he looks just like me)
But I haven't seen her in a while
(ever since she tried to fight me)
Know she's permanent
That's it, oh shit
City paper's in the mail
(looka here at what I started)
But if I lay that pipe down?
(maybe then she'll drop the charges)
Vicious cycle, (cycle) cycle
Girl is psycho
Yes, she's loco
No, she's sexy as she wanna be
It was all my phony words
(babies making babies making)

[Who's the reason for my daddy's grin?]
The answer
[It's true]
Your momma (for the baby)
[It's true]
Brings the drama (think about the baby)
[It's true]
Think she got me
[It's true]
Cause I'm your father
[Suffers even when it's you to blame]

Fixing up a broken home
[It's true]
We can do it
[It's true]
But that shit didn't last too long
Going through it

[Who's the reason for my daddy's grin?]
The answer
[It's true] (It's true)
Your momma (your momma)
[It's true]
Brings the drama (brings the drama)
[It's true]
Then she got me (then she got me cause)
[It's true]
Cause I'm your father (I'm your father)
[Suffers even when it's you to blame]

[It's true]
How did this happen?
[It's true]
Thought I was mackin' but
[It's true]
Aww...
[Suffers even when it's you to blame]

[It's true]
How did this happen?
[It's true]
Thought I was mackin'
[It's true]
Macking
[It's true]
Played the game too long
[Suffers even when it's you to blame]
Falling off

[Outro]
You know Adam from uptown, right? I can't believe he's gone
He got caught up having that baby, thinking with the wrong head...
I'm gonna miss him so much... Poor Adam, he was just another
Victim
