[Santa Ana Wind, singing]
Hello there, it's me
I'm the Santa Ana winds
I cause allergies
I also make things weird

A little bit about me
I'm a hot, hot breeze
That originates from high-pressure air masses
Technically, I'm known as a katabatic wind
That's science for "a pain in your asses"

I'm mystical but also carry dangerous spores
I bring whimsy and forest fires
When I blow, there's magic in the air
And a higher risk of suicide

I make children wheeze
'Cause I'm the Santa Ana winds
To reiterate, I make things weird
When I blow, it sounds like "whee!"

I'll be back Because I'm the wind
And also kind of a narrator

Hey, it's me again
I'm the Santa Ana winds
Here's some magic dust
Which will make things weird

They had the same dream
They just got Santa Ana winded

You might say, "Don't do it, wind
Leave these poor people alone"
But I'm a prankster
Tee-hee-hee-hee
I just wanna see what will happen

You're looking really guilty

[Rebecca, talking]
Move aside

[Santa Ana Wind, singing]
You can't push the wind

[Rebecca, talking]
Oh, you
That kiss was all your fault

[Santa Ana Wind, singing]
I just reveal your deepest wishes and fears
So it's you, Rebecca It's not me
Who is super weird
Super weird
You're super weird

[Rebecca, talking]
No, I'm not! Get away from me! Go back to Santa Ana! Or I don't know if that's where you're from or that's where you're going

[Santa Ana Wind, singing]
You ruined everything
You stupid bitch
