[Intro: Cognito & Hopsin]
Yo, just Justo hand me that motherfucking Vic bottle
Yeah, Hopsin
Gimme that shit
Yo Cognito
Hopsin
What up?
What's up? West Coast
Anarchy Nation
West Coast in this motherfucker
Funk Volume
Anarchy Nation, Funk Volume (Hahaha)
Makin' me feel like I'm [?] of this motherfuckin' beat
You know what I mean
Come on

[Verse 1: Cognito]
You ever seen a schizophrenic? (Yeah)
Went Valium and liquors blended (Uhuh)
Cool-aid with liquor in it? (Yep)
You're sick but can't admit it? (Ughh)
Fuck the same hoes for three nights straight?
You're on a hooker run (Haha)
And then you drop her off at the same shelter you took her from (Get out!)
Nicked her 'cause she looking dumb (What?)
Brain the size of a cookie crumb (What?)
Tell yourself, "it could be fun" (What?)
It's just a late night nooky run (What?)
Now everybody thinks you're pathetic (Ha)
Maybe they right (Right, haha)
It's just a minor situation to regret later in life (Yes)
You making late night telly runs for nothing (Haha)
While you snorting fresh eighties off her belly button
While avoiding that smelly muffin (Ughh)
You the dirty of the dirtiest slut bags
Wanna pump rags, and nut cup grabs
And but-fucks fags while hittin' it from behind
And let his nut cup sag, dressed in drag
And blamed it on his tough-luck past
And fucked up dad (Ugh, dad!)
Yeah, your issues run deeper than heavy sedation
Off a clinic prescribed medication
You a fucking disgrace, so just face it

[Chorus]
You don't see what I see coming
Anarchy is coming for you
I'm an outcast
An anarchy soldiers strapped up
And letting loose on any motherfucker that act up
You don't see what I see coming
Anarchy is coming for you
And I'm forming a congregation
Your chance is nothing short of an annihilation
You fucking with the Anarchy Nation

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yeah, uh
I come tumbling in 'bout to bubble again
I crumble the pen with writing so I'm under your skin
I'm here (Yo, where the fuck have you been?)
Juggling sin, I'm good now, I could be your most humblest friend
All you haters, watch who the fuck you offend
'Fore I throw you inside a hole ass-naked and shovel you in
I started up a new trend, still didn't puzzle you then
Shit, I ain't 'bout to be fake
Ain't got the guts to pretend
I ought to shove a syringe right in your heart and then drain it, homie
I understand the industry is part entertainment
Pardon my phases, I know I'm a little argument-raising
But our music has died and it's gon' take an artists to save it
I just target the fakest niggas then start an invasion
We all know most of the rappers that are far from amazing
But yeah, we treat 'em like the King of Rap
Fuck the mic, nigga, we could scrap
Stop the hating, I'm just speaking facts

[Chorus]
You don't see what I see coming
Anarchy is coming for you
I'm an outcast
An anarchy soldiers strapped up
And letting loose on any motherfucker that act up
You don't see what I see coming
Anarchy is coming for you
And I'm forming a congregation
Your chance is nothing short of an annihilation
You fucking with the Anarchy Nation

[Verse 3: Cognito]
Homie needs some Red Bull
My eye's always wide except when I'm snoring
I never hit a bitch, I knew that I would regret in the morning (Nope)
They try to tell me to stop poppin' them pills and smoking them ports (Haha)
I'd rather fuck a one-legged hooker with asshole warts (Ughh)
And a glass eye with a peg leg and died of starvation
And got a puss that make a dead fish smell like a carnation (Ughh)
Call me a sick fuck, but sticks and stones
See I'm insultable
And got a dick that could give your girl multiples (Ooo)
Before I told the whore that I'm "outie" (Yep)
Told her it's sort of a hobby (Haha)
When I got bored of the potty (Right)
Escort the whore to the lobby
Then I pat her down, make sure their ain't no recording on me (Nu-huh)
There's always more to a hottie than knives and a gorgeous body
You're pissed off, (Yep) 'cause by the time your bitch gets off (What)
She be callin' me up, complaining how you're limp dick soft (Lil')
She too classy for you and I got the feeling she sorta naughty (Come here, for real)
So I took her 'round the back and we fucking in a porta potty (Right here)

[Chorus]
You don't see what I see coming
Anarchy is coming for you
I'm an outcast
An anarchy soldiers strapped up
And letting loose on any motherfucker that act up
You don't see what I see coming
Anarchy is coming for you
And I'm forming a congregation
Your chance is nothing short of an annihilation
You fucking with the Anarchy Nation
