[Verse 1]
Now that I signed with Strange Music
The industry bout to lose it
They basically want the new shit
I'm anxiously off to prove it
Contagiously I'm the nuisance
They wait to see if the shoe fits
Say that I never knew this
I'm made up to be the truest
I'm making to rest look foolish
The rest of em wonder who is
The one that's making the nooses
The same that's making the music
They take a try to abuse it
They fakin' until they lose it
They fakin' because they choose it
I'm rapin' em just to prove it

[Hook]
Like I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm walkin' down the road I've never seen
And can't nobody hold me back, I'm free
If I gotta go I'm takin' y'all with me
I feel like I'm bout to lose it
I'm walkin' down the road I've never seen
And can't nobody hold me back, I'm free
If I gotta go I'm takin' the world with me
I'm going crazy

[Verse 2]
They never thought it would happen but I'm better than never
I'm better than better, gotta finish this unsettle vandetta
For letter by letter, you picture for me dry if I let up
But I told she wasn't my type from the first time that I met her
I'm spreadin' like a virus through the veins, minus the violence
They want em silenced but I'm poking like [?] to your sinus
I'm Cali finest, not to be mindless but honestly [?]
Rappers still be scared of cops when they'll be ridin' behind us
Now I'm back to the bank for more dough
Then I'm back to the bank with more dough
Now I'm back with a second solo while they're keepin' movin' in slow-mo
And it's funny that I live like that, kickin' where I get high at
Keep bodies in the meat like where I keep the rip by at
Automatic they panic, fanatics to attics'
Watch their mechanics when I'm on xanax, spit annex in spanish
Come on and stop, dos señoritas [?] ménage à trois
Now everybody seems to know who we are
I'm goin' crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sittin' back countin' my money, 1 quarter, 2 quarter, 3
One more quarter equals a dollar, who's more richer than me?
Gotta be sorta psychotic, melodic he flows in ebonics, erratic
Sittin' in his cottage with bunch of narcotics
I ain't never astonish honest, all I need is my goddess
When I was 8 I had something sick for sitter, I did wanna hit her
20 years later, dick little bigger I still wanna get her
Maybe I should go online and hit her on twitter
So then I can talk to the masses and fill up them shots in the glasses
Crazy how off that he passes, when he gets lost in the masses
See how I feel in the mornin' got this hangover going
That ain't good, standing on pouring so they start to ignore em
I ain't try to support em, he's just lucky mom didn't abort em
He's so dope that they should cut em in the lines and snort em
I got my mind on this money and this money on my mind
But I feel like I'm runnin' out of time, gotta take back what's mine
I'm goin' crazy

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Got a granade in my hand and I'm starin' at the pen
While I'm thinking I'm about to do some dumb shit again
Call the coroner, tell him I'm bringin' more of them
He probably shake his head cause he got no place to store them
X2
