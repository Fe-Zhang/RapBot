Chorus:
See I was barely 16 and was getting record deals, God Damn
I was barely 17 and was paying all my bills, God Damn
Was about to turn 16 chillin with my nigga in the studio,Blvvk Ink call him Ndumio
Fake negus tryna do me hoe, Imma do me, Keep doing shows, music and radio etc
Etcetera (repeated)
I said it bruh, I heard it bruh, etcetera etcetera etcetera

Verse I:
The devil's inside me, I try not to feed it
But these other rappers just try to get eaten
These other rappers dont know that fucking with Eve and ive been in the Garden of Eden

You know you have seen him You wanted to be him
You couldn't get through so you tried to defeat him
Long story short, im still outchea, im breathing
Im coming for you, imma mufucken heathen

Hiding in haven, its feeling like heaven
Rappers I ended, plus minus 11, add another 7 I conquered several
On another level that you cannot handle

With the brethren, man the problem is ended
Them negus are settle, I murdered their ghetto
I murdered their bando
Walk inside with choppers, I ain't hesitate to tell all their bitches to bend over

I am a menace
A rapping apprentice
That conquered the masses, and fuck all their asses
VIP passes, the living is lavish
You owe me a favour, I handle the leverage
No sweating me man I dont need no beverage
You negus ain't even on average

The levels im reaching upgrade every season
Say hello to haters, Guess im Lionel Richie
They sound abit bitchy, while ill be here practicing
Preaching for green, I guess I am Luigi

Fuck your palm readers man,I am your Ouija
Thats why I go overboard, with these lyrics
The girls are a weakness
I try to stay far from these bitches
Don't cross me, I ain't no bridges

Repeat their old shit,like FIFA commentators
Serving negus like the commissary
Dont entertain the haters
We are very scary
And in terms of killin negus
They never see me cumming like Virgin Mary

[Chorus + 50 cent sample]

Verse II:
Tell em the album is coming
I don’t like rappers who fronting but back up when they see the beast i’m becoming
I am the king like homecoming
I am the nigga that got your bitch cumming

Try verse me maybe you’ll come out alive
I will not rest till i’m at Sound Alive
I will not rest till my sound is alive
Like i chill with Pac in the stuu every time

Im killing shit all the time , all of these beats that i’m hearing and screaming out “oh what a time”
Killing rappers and i’m still in my prime
Only thing holding me down is my pride

Fuck all these negus that be earning figures but rap shit every time i see them in stages
Fuck all these negus that doubted the album but downloaded this song just to hear the outcome
Fuck all these negus that claiming they eagles , but not even falcons
Fuck all these bitches that wanted my money , y’all ain’t my exes , not even Malcom X

The album is coming and we on some new shit
To fans i’m the greatest , to rappers a nuisance
All of these rappers rap bullshit , than they hear my music and ask people who is this new kid

Either y’all stupid or can't see the fact that i’m winning so much there ain’t no room for losing
I am the nigga that conquered the greatest to facts where my old shit compares to their latest
I am the nigga that don’t give a fuck if they throw shade on me or they put me with favorites
Im making music so different that people don’t even believe i was rapping on Misfits

If i played this song to my father i swear he would trip over mischief and go tell his Mrs
I’ve got a sniper so they’ll never notice the shots i’ve been taking from all of this distance
I run this game so much i overlap and create some more distance
I am the chorus on Misfits but my voice is changing so much you would swear it was Marshall who killed it
Shout out to negus
