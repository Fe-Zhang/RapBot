[Chorus x2]
Let me come clean
I've been down in the dirt
Don't get caught up on the details baby
But I been the worst

[Verse]
I said I'm down to die for you like
Been around like 3 or 4 tonight
Usually I'm more the loyal type
But I've been sitting on the boarder line
Temptations on my mind
Impatient all the time
She ask me do you mind
Close my eyes love is blind
I know lately shit been looking Rocky Balboa
Ducking on the daily acting like I don't know ya
Truth is I just can't fess up to what I been doing
They say if the shoe fits, now it's time to try to show 'em

[Chorus x3]
Let me come clean
I've been down in the dirt
Don't get caught on the details baby
But I been the worst
