[Verse 1]
We gon' stop and boo the whole team to go
If she won't pop it then she green light to roll
If she a queen then she get treated like it, for sure
But cuffin' hoes that's been around the team, so know
That last year I did some things I never thought I'd do
'Cause last year I put up numbers no one thought I'd do
I need the wraith and a place to live, you pinging it
I see the hate but all the words fall on deaf ears
Silence

[Verse 2]
We want no distractions
If I said I'll make it happen then I know it happen
I barely sleep, I live on fancy captions
Taking naps and get cold feet tryna find my step and get the traction (Yeah)
Your fake beef's lame, you stagin' (Whoa)
Well I fuck bitches off my stage name (Whoa)
We not even in the same lane (Whoa)
Stick to aiming for your Triple J place (Whoa)

[Bridge]
I doubted them but now they show me love undoubtedly
Just 'cause they lookin' out, don't mean they lookin' out for me
Under pressure from the next to work for salaries
I got bigger plans
Hit me in a year and ask me how it's workin' out for me

[Chorus]
I'm good (I'm good)
Way I see it, if I'm doing what I want then I'm living
If I'm living then I'm winning
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Nothing changed but the women and the linens in the places that I visit
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Way I see it, if I'm doing what I want then I'm living
If I'm living then I'm winning
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)

[Verse 3]
You hit up labels for a come-up man (Yeah)
While labels come-up tryna use my name (Yeah)
I'm independent, I don't owe a thing
They chained us down so now I'm putting pendants on my whole gang (Yeah)
Really, there's no comparison
I see the flex, it's embarrassing
I'm in sessions in Paris
And I spent cheques out in Paris
The distance ain't the only reason that you rappers ain't near us
It's different
We global

[Verse 4]
And life is beautiful
Watch the ones that new to you
There's plenty you got going on but what is they gon' do for you?
My crew is through and through
Don't listen to the rumors to get too caught up, that shit gon' ruin you (Yeah)
I watch the hours tick (Yeah)
I'm tryna make my parents proud as shit (Yeah)
That's why I can't waste time with rappin' shit
Got so much going on to think you don't see half of it
Probably been hit up by your favorite rapper's management (It's crazy)

[Bridge]
I doubted them but now they show me love undoubtedly
Just 'cause they lookin' out, don't mean they lookin' out for me
Under pressure from the next to work for salaries
I got bigger plans
Hit me in a year and ask me how it's workin' out for me

[Chorus]
I'm good
Way I see it, if I'm doing what I want then I'm living
If I'm living then I'm winning
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Nothing changed but the women and the linens in the places that I visit
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Way I see it, if I'm doing what I want then I'm living
If I'm living then I'm winning
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
