[Verse 1]
Oh, to me it sound crazy (Crazy)
How you put in time and he just donâ€™t appreciate it?
Need to get out of the house more, you gettin' jaded
You at home all alone while he gettin' faded
Need to stop givin' chances
He gonna take 'em and dip
Now I'm dippin' through your end of the woods
And I wish a player would right now
If he try to act tough
I'ma tell that pussy-boy, "battyboy back down"
'Cause you can't claim her
You don't even show her love when she need you 'round
I'm a player, but for her I'll probably change my ways right now
Ah, yeah
Find it wild how he can't see you there
Find it wild how he can't see your worth
Probably gon' miss that if you dip
Probably go crazy, lose his shit
If he saw you inside my whip
Probably go pull out that full clip
'Cause you got that shit he gon' miss
But he just don't see it

[Hook]
All that badonk-donk in your trunk-trunk, I know
He move too fast girl and you need it slow
You need that time girl, that real time for you, oh
I got that time girl, that real time, I do

[Verse 2]
Oh, to me it sound crazy
Probably runnin' 'round with another lady
I don't mean to get up all in your business
But if you would let a real one finish
But if you would let a real one in it
Girl, I know you done there
Yeah, I know you ain't silly
You can see past all that
Don't even hit him with a callback
Girl, just hit him with a fallback text
I just wanted, yeah, all that
Girl, I wanted, wanted all that
Yes, if he hit you with a sorry
Tell his sorry ass, "sorry ain't payin' no bills 'round here"
Yeah, I know how that feels 'round here
Did it once, did it twice
Yeah, it kills 'round here
Ah, yeah

[Hook]
All that badonk-donk in your trunk-trunk, I know
He move too fast girl and you need it slow
You need that time, girl, that real time for you (Oh)
I got that time, girl, that real time, I do
(Oh, to me it sound crazy)

All that badonk-donk in your trunk-trunk, I know
He move too fast girl and you need it slow
You need that time, girl, that real time for you (Oh)
I got that time, girl, that real time, I do
(Oh, to me it sound crazy)

[Bridge]
Oh, to me it sound crazy
Oh, to me it sound crazy
Switch sides, switch sides
Good, bad, no lie
Hit that comeback, you know I like
Foreplay, five-play, six-play, seven-play
One-day, two-day, three-day, every day

[Hook]
All that badonk-donk in your trunk-trunk, I know
He move too fast girl and you need it slow
You need that time, girl, that real time for you (Oh)
I got that time, girl, that real time, I do
(Oh, to me it sound crazy)

All that badonk-donk in your trunk-trunk, I know
He move too fast girl and you need it slow
You need that time, girl, that real time for you (Oh)
I got that time, girl, that real time, I do
(Oh, to me it sound crazy)

[Outro]
Girl, I see you in your skin tight dress and your lipstick wet
Goddamn
Find it hard to settle down
Yeah, hard to settle down, but with you, I can
Oh, you lookin' in the mirror
Oh, you checkin' out your body
Got you feelin' insecure
He never told you, you a hottie
Damn, to me that sound absurd
