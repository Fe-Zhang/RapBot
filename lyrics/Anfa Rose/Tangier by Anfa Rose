[Chorus]
I ain't tryna get no Zzz's
When I tell you I wanna sleep in it
Fuck around and call you my Habibi
Don't make it too easy
I think she half middle eastern
I'm a North African but you can find me on the eastern
I'm tryna throw you in the deep end
Oh Ayi hablas espa単ol
Tell me are we freakin'
So all I need to hear is "si" then?

[Verse 1]
Girl lets get out of here, I won't lie
I been watching you, the whole night
For you I go the whole 18 though
Full throttle I ain't stopping for a road sign
Soon as you give me the green light, it's go time
'Cuz there's no time, there's no time
Bar cleaning out, looking like it's close time
'Cuz there's no time, there's no time

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna get no Zzz's
When I tell you I wanna sleep in it
Fuck around and call you my Habibi
Don't make it too easy
I think she half middle eastern
I'm a North African but you can find me on the eastern
I'm tryna throw you in the deep end
Oh Ayi hablas espa単ol
Tell me are we freakin'
So all I need to hear is "si" then?

[Verse 2]
Off the coast of Tangier
Slightly off the hash, yeah
Had your heartbroken last year
But lets leave that in the past tense
The DJ playing Se単orita
You know all the words
I know what you deserve, oh
So before you leave first

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna get no Zzz's
When I tell you I wanna sleep in it
Fuck around and call you my Habibi
Don't make it too easy
I think she half middle eastern
I'm a North African but you can find me on the eastern
I'm tryna throw you in the deep end
Oh Ayi hablas espa単ol
Tell me are we freakin'
So all I need to hear is "si" then?
