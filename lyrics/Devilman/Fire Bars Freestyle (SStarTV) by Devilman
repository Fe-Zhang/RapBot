[Intro]
Yooo, Hold tight DJ Jawzy yeah
S-StarTV, get to know this
And it's the D.E.Velopment
And I'm not into no fucking around
Okay then let me do it like this

[Devilman]
Yo
In the morning I wake and bake
Smoke a zoot then bang up my flake
The cocaine I've got brings all the boys to the yard
So I don't need no milkshake
I need to find my love like Drake
There's only so much that I can take
If my girl thinks she can cheat on me
I'll put heroin in her birthday cake
I need to calm down for my own sake
I ain't got time to make no mistake
I go to bed early I wake up late
Bare wasteman wanna' hate on my ting
But my face ain't bothered like Catherine Tate
My bars are bigger than the United State
I believe in karma and fate
I'll take you all out of the game, checkmate
Get me out of here now
I wanna get signed but I don't know how
I always end up writing my best lyrics
After me and my girlfriend's had a row
I'm from Birmingham, not from Slough
Old school like when Lethal B said Pow
When people hear me spit
I automatically get a round of applause and a bow
I used to play Modern Warfare 2
But I play Black Ops now
I married one African girl so she could stay in the country
Then I renewed my vow
I used to sell MDMA and Meow
But I ain't got none on me now
I went to link one ting that I used to link from time ago
And she said come on me now

Bumbaclaaaarted

[Outro]
