[Hook: Devilman]
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father

Yo

[Verse 1: Devilman]
I am the drum and bass father
Gully like Gaza
Don't wear Gucci, don't wear Prada
When I have sex I like to push it in harder
Strangle the bitch with her iPhone charger
Enough of them think (yo) they're big but I'm larger
What goes around comes around like Karma
Fuck the President, fuck Barrack Obama
All they give a fuck about is guns and armour
'Cos I'm addictive like candy crush saga
See me with a big spliff and a glass of Cava
Biggin' up dizzle kid and Badness LAVA
I don't give a fuck I'm a drum and bass barer
I ain't got no animals but I'm a farmer
Traumatik's got the harvest of marijuana
I was in a hotel room with one freaky bitch
She was masturbating with a banana
I'm the number one challenger
I'm like a football manager
Annihilate and damage ya
Then cannibalize and savage ya
Drinking blood like Dracula
I'm amazing and spectacular
When it's late, don't ring my phone
Send me a message I'll get back to ya
When you here me and Badness back to back
Make ya wanna give your Mum a happy slap
Turning dad into an unhappy chap
I'll fuck you up just like a gram of crack
Come out of nowhere like a heart attack
Don't talk shit, Don't start your crap
You know what I know what I mean (yeah)
My time turn on the mic like yo
D.E.V I run the show
Check out my lyrical dirty flow
I get about like a dirty ho
I spit my bars at a fast tempo
When I'm on grime I spit them slow
When I drop my bars at a rave
You know the roof is gonna blow
I've got the lyrical magical flow
D.E.V I'm running the show
You might hear me on the drums and bass
Or you might hear me on the 1-4-0
I've got the lyrical magical flow
D.E.V I'm running the show
You might hear me on the drums and bass
Or you might hear me on the 1-4-0

[Hook: Devilman]
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father
I am the drum and bass father

Yo

Yo

[Verse 2: Badness]
I'm Biggin up back back you know it
Now it's time for me to show it
I'm back, I'm back, you know it
I'm Biggin up back back you know it
Now it's time for me to show it
I'm back, I'm back, you know it
You're immature, amateur, immature, premature
Checking in this with MC Badness with lyrics galore
You're immature, amateur, immature, premature
Checking in this with MC Badness with lyrics galore
I might knock you out like Prince Naseem
Coming to America, I'm a king
Alien from outta space
Come to Earth to run the place
Got my gas, got my mace
9 millimeter in my waist
Time to pop you in your face
Time to pump you in your face
I might knock you out like prince Naseem (this is real)
Coming to America, I'm a king
Alien from outta space
Come to Earth to run the place
Got my gas, got my mace
9 milometer in my waist
Time to pump you in your face
Time to pump you in your face
I might knock you out like prince Naseem (this is real)
Coming to America, I'm a king
Alien from outta space
Come to Earth to run the place
Got my gas, got my mace
9 milometer in my waist
Time to pump you in your face
Time to pump you in your face

[Verse 3: Devilman]
I am a lyrical murderer
I'll take out a third of ya
Don't know your lyrics
Don't know your flow
Trust me fam I ain't heard of ya
Could've been from Mexico
Could've been from suburbia
My lyrics will keep disturbing ya
Here's one I made earlier
My style you can't match it
Light man up like a match stick
Where's his head gone?
I separated, then reattached it
'Cos I told you already
I'm sick like Jason and Freddy
More heavier than a fat mans belly
Come to your house and jack mans telly
When I'm on the mic can't move like this
Man a man can't move like that
Man a man can't move like this or move like that
Covered in bubbling fat
It's the D.E.Velopment on the attack
Under the mat
Everybody move your head to this one
Could've been Chinese, White or Black
When im on the mic i move like this
When im on the mic i move like this
When im on the mic i move like this
When im on the mic i move like this or that
Covered in bubbling fat
It's the D.E.Velopment on the attack
Under the mat
Everybody move your head to this one
Could've been Chinese, White or Black
When im on the mic i move like this
When im on the mic i move like this
When im on the mic i move like this
When im on the mic i move like this or that
Covered in bubbling fat
It's the D.E.Velopment on the attack
Under the mat
Everybody move your head to this one
Could've been Chinese, White or Black
