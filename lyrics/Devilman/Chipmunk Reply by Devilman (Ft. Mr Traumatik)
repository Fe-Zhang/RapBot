[Intro: Mr Traumatik]
Oi, Chipmunk, you thick cunt; your ship's sunk
So I quick dunk six chunks of shit lumps
On his lip once then quick punch, leave six lumps on his big head
Fuck off (Dickhead)
Chipmunk you thick cunt, your ship's sunk
So I quick dunk six chunks of shit lumps
On his lip once then quick punch, leave six lumps on his big head
Fuck off

[Verse 1: Devilman]
I am the meet and greeter
Hot like heater, vegetable eater
Chipmunk's on some sideman ting, passenger seater
Come like Skepta, lyrical repeater
Don't call out my name on a track, say my name on a track, like say some feature
Come to your house on a Jamaican 'ting, box you up in your face and bleach ya, teach ya, I'm an animal; I'm a creature
Nobody ain't gonna save or reach ya
Go to church and be a preacher
Grime? You don't belong round 'ere
Mainstream? You don't belong there either
I heard that you lick-a-dick-a-day take a breather
You ain't bad and Jammer ain't either
Wunsen
When I do shit I do shit properly
Eat up a man like spinach and broccoli
Kill Skepta and dump him in Hockley
None of these MCs can top me
Trust me I don't give a fuck if you've got P
You man are pop stars, you're not top three
Trust me fam, that's not me
You're not gonna get away scot-free
When I spit bars, I'm conflicting a bit of pain
You man are just wet like Lil' Wayne
Sold out for a bit of fame, try come back to grime to make a bit of change
Fuck Chip Diddy Chip, slap him in the lip, little prick better get a grip
Yeah, fuck Chip Diddy Chip, slap him in the lip, little prick better get a grip
I specialise in pain and slaughter
I gave him a ten pound draw and he paid me the money for a quarter
Drown yourself in water
Chipmunk's on a funny-man-'ting, I heard that he got a boyfriend in Majorca
Pedo, you're a nonce, you're a stalker
You might as well do the Moonwalker
You wanna know where I'm at, I'm in 0121
Shutting it down so you best just do one
Nobody don't give a fuck about you don
Even your grime tune sounds like a pop song
Don't let Jammer and them lot fool ya', I'm gonna school ya'
Go on then go on then, draw for the tool ya'
Box you in the face with a ruler
Yo, I'll make the tables turn on you
Shit, piss and sperm on you
I'm gonna end your career, after this even your girl might turn on you
It's not fair on you
You're not ready to clash me, I'll get Claire on you
Slap you in the face with a dirty nappy then throw a pushchair on you
Yeah, 'cause you're not ready
You transvestite, you're not ready
Don't talk shit about clash, you like to hit a man's ass cause it gives you a semi
I said you're not ready
You transvestite you're not ready
I don't care if you're in a video with Jammer, smash a man's head with a telly
Check my flow, check my slang
This guy looks like an orangutan
I don't give a fuck how many girls you bang, you're still a wanker
That's why you hurt your hand
I heard you suck dick for twos on a fag
Or lick a man's balls just for a gram
I know what you're doing, I saw the plan
You're lucky that I didn't get to record a man
You know what I mean, yeah
(You know what I mean, yeah)
You don't wanna feel that burning sensation
I got a Pitbull and I got a Staffie
I got a Bullmastiff and a Alsation
(If you call out my name on a track)
Make you feel worse than dehydration
(I'll end your career, that's a fact)
Leave your face with a major alteration

[Outro: Devilman]
Chipmunk, your career finished
Yeah
I'm not even wasting no more bars on this prick
Yeah, fuck Chipmunk
Fuck Boy Better Know
Fuck Lord Of The Mics, yeah
This is what it is
Wunsen!
