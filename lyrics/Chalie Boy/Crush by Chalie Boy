Do you like me? Yes
Do you like me? No
Circle either one an holla back just let me know
But you never did thanks to my kinfolk
Running interference you played me for a joke
Gotta be assertive but is it worth it
Look at you your perfect, a chance with you I deserve it
But I'm so nervous. Come to your crib
I like you babe. Empty space
You moved away before I got a chance to say

Chorus: (2x)
I've got a crush well it's more than a crush
On you no I'm not crazy. I'm just waving on
Words of saying I want you

I've got a thing for you
And I just can't let it go

Bridge:
Seems like a dream can't be reality
But in all actuality your here shifting my gravity
Can't seem to move I can't seem to speak
No I'm not SWV but you making me weak
My minds playing tricks on me
Cause you can't be this close and I
Not have enough nerve to come tell you how I feel the most
How am I suppose to tell the one I think I love
I love them well don't know if they ever noticed me before

Repeat Chorus

See you don't need no promise ring
Because I'm promising
That right now baby I vow to be your everything
I'll be your special guy
A fool for you my dear
Every hour, every day, every year
