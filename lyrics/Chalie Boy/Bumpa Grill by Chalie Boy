[Verse 1:]
This For Them Fordsmobile Buicks And Them Chevys
Cadillacs 24 Inches High Slidin On Pirellis
Candy Coded Gloss Had Bad Know It Scrape Tha Belly
Beat In Tha Trunk Turnin Buildins Into Confetti
Country Gramma Like Nelly
We speak with a drawl
But slower something like in our slabs we creep and we crawl
Hit  a button and you know the roof and screens fall
Jammin Screwed Up Tilla Though We Ain't Too Tired To Ball Roof be candy-coated caprice be flippin' like I'm the law
See that shirt On that bop got enough knock to pop It off
Old head cats tellin me, "Chalie you need to knock it off!"
I just did, look again im bout to pop the bra
Im from them dirty third coast where we keepin' it raw
Yo slab's up against ours, you think that you beatin Us? Naw
Re-pimp yo ride cause slabs down in da south be nasty y'all Think that its sumthin just wait till we pull out them classic cars Candy Paint Drip Like It Was Fresh Out Of Molasses Jar Futuristic, got Customization, Its way past the stars,Mayne!

[Chorus:]
I Got My Mind On Forum But Im Swangin The Bumpa Grill [x13]

[Verse 2:]
Ain't No Need In Askin Boy Yes Im A Winner
Bourbon On 24s Wit VVS in the spinner
Leather seats and my name in diamonds rest in center
And the only time this whip gettin' caressed is in the winter Neva A beginner, I'm an iced-out champ
Lift the bracelet on my wrist and catch an iced-out cramp
I'm a dog and my woofers barkin' nothin' but Freeon
Cuz its powered by an iced-out amp

[Chalie Speaking:]
Hol' up, hold up Rapid Ric, Imma slow downb and bring it back for my boy Brandon Chisom in Tyler, Texas. one of the first CDs I ever got on. Ain't no holds barred baby

[Verse 3:]
Ain't No Need In Askin Boy Yes Im A Winner
Bourbon On 24s Wit VVS in the spinner
Leather seats and my name in diamonds rest in center
And the only time this whip gettin' caressed is in the winter Neva A beginner, I'm an iced-out champ
Lift the bracelet on my wrist and catch an iced-out cramp
I'm a dog and my woofers barkin' nothin' but Freeon
Cuz its powered by an iced-out amp
Platinum princess cuts, or invisible sets
Going up against us is like youre making an invisible bets
You can't see us!
Envious niggas wanting to be us
Untamed, already off of the chain
You can't free us from the south
VVS diamond in mouths
Swangin' 'round in my slab
Showing [them] boys what we 'bout
Think you got anybody better
Well put up your cheddar
And tell them Chalie Boi said get up, go get em and bring em out
??? in the lone star state
??? muthafuka everything is still great
Country boy not from the city but  me be making my way
Cause me grind and me hustle, me making my pay
From no ice to iced up
Broke ass to ???  up
Slangin' CDs in the hood like mules slanging white stuff
Multi million dollar
