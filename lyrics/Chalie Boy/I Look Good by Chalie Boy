[Verse 1: Chalie Boy]
Hundred on a neckware, fifty on a stop-watch
Staring at the diamonds make ya bust it, baby, hop-scotch
Over here to my spot, say she wanna party
I do it big baby like my L.R.G
Show the Ed Hardy when I’m feeling like a rock band
Eighty-seven jeans and white-T when on the block man
J’s still rocking, Forces still moving
Chuck Taylor´s killing, Adidas still grooving
Locs on my face, but that´s just the front
Take em off and show the hazels when I wanna stunt
Get ya high like a blunt, rollin' up the best
Fruity Pebbles got her hands rolling up my chest
With me you don´t wanna mess mane, touch my (Swag)
Thousand dollar bandanna make you throw the white (Flag)
Get into the whip game, momma had the bread
Paint grain want me swang, bang, and make ya mad mane!

[Verse 2: Chalie Boy]
Ballin' is a drug that I don´t mind abusing
Coogi on my body, Jaywalking in the fusions
Hit the [?] get it poppin' in the illusions
Tell ya right now plex-c catch contusions
Cool as a fan, hot like a flame
Boys throwin' Haterade on me still ain´t a stain
Double shots rain, hand on Patron
Round of that white, it all depend what you on
Shawty jocking my cologne, Creed will make ya hurt
Three hundred a bottle, thirty dollars for a squirt
Got you sweatin' out ya shirt
You can get the biz
Somethin' on ya mind
What it do? What it is?
Can´t close your eyelids
See the fit and the fitted
Yeah, I’m guilty of ballin´, but I bet I’ll get acquitted
Gone in a minute, you probably hate though
I put it in ya face, bro, I stay throwed

[Verse 3: Chalie boy]
Shawty´s in the club, yeah
See a lot of BB
Gucci and Niche and B.C.B.G
Dolce & Gabbana, oh I want her, mama pardon me
Rockin' your Republic Apple Bottom in that House of Dereon
Slowly to some R&B
Think we need some R&R
Take me to the V.I.P. and drive me like a foreign car
Poppin' my purple label, Ralph Lauren collar
Look like money, smell like dollars
Shawty look sexy, smell like Prada
Christian Louboutins makin' hating hoes holla
Pop a Grey Goose bottle and let´s carry on
Grip ya Baby Phat and Trojan man carry me home
Thuggin' make ya mama moan, got a Blackberry phone
Tryna catch me sliding in a [?]
Ya make the band like Sean Combs, too fly to be shown
C.H.A.L.I.E. I´m gone, mane
