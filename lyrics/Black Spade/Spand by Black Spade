[Intro]
They burn chasing
Like a bitch in a race
Out here facing, going right in his face
The whole highlight
Kept me in his place
The elders look
Say, "What a disgrace"

[Hook]
We gave the drama
I can tell it's gonna be a long summer
Hope we both make it out alive

[Verse 1]
It is what it is, some fake it til they make it
If you can't see I'm not for the bullshit, then you need Lasix
Opportunity knock, it wanted me to take it
Ball in the fall, even in the coldest winter
They say life's a bitch, well niggas like me get to pimp her
Cause success of wack motherfuckers will make you lose your temper
This forever anger like when Bush knocked down the buildings
This the raise of wackness; "Pat fucking Tillman"
That's what he chanted out right before they fucking killed him
Ghetto children, bastards born into drama
On the streets of Midwest, where they put llamas to your mama
If I have to go tomorrow, let em know that I was dedicated
And make my name a holiday so that they can go and celebrate it
Let em know I died twice even before I meditated
My love for this hip-hop, let em know it's complicated
My love for this hip-hop, let em know it's complicated

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cause it's the have and the have-nots
Make a nigga want to rob a bank and lick two shots
And the leader and the robots
Saying don't complain bout what you ain't got
Well fuck that, I been beat by two cops
Sob story, bring two mops
Don't let me litter, pick it up when my shit drops
Cause it's the beauty in the contrast
Rich, poor, well-off, or is it middle class
Beyond broke with a gold member ghetto pass
Stamp card in the mail like free at last
Getting drove by the machine, run out of gas
Put your lighters in the air for the unsung
The sufferers, coal miners dying of black lung
The ones with no voice or tongues
From yo hood to his hood to where I'm from

[Hook]
