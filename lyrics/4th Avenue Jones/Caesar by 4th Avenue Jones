Caesar I wanna see ya, we scared of police not North Korea
I sweat and bleed working' to feed mi familia
Wear a jacket every day full metal, I'm from the ghetto
Where teens forced to settle so they scream like a kettle
Gang bang and exchange drugs they try to peddle
Lost love from living' as thugs since they was little
Go to the Sire tell him we bringing' his empire down
When my Messiah returns he's gonna try ya
Every liar will perish in lakes burning with fire
Murdering thieves how much peace does money buy'ya
Let's educate the homies cause the game has changed
Instead of wrists they making' sure our brains are chained
Let's reminisce, how many of us hanged and slain
And now we pimp our women as a claim to fame
You're just a puppet
Dumb Elmo playing with flames
These are the last days and it's finna rain
That's why they entertain us
Everybody loves ya when you're famous
Hating everybody else who ain't us
All we want is more
Overlooking poor people in anguish
Dollars are the universal language
I want to see Caesar
