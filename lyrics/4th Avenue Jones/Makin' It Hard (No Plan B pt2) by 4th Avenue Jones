So rough, so tough, 4th Ave, baby...
So rough, so tough, 4th Ave, baby...

[Hook: Ahmad]
Makin' it hard on me...
Pulling me over when I drive when I'm strictly legit'
Makin' it hard on me...
Be doing everything they can trying to get us to quit
Makin' it hard on me...
Whenever we doing a show we be hyping the spot
Makin' it hard on me...
4th Avenue is fittin' to blow whether you like it or not

[Verse 1: Ahmad]
If I aim I got to shoot it
I started running the game the day I got recruited
'cause I'm tight. That's undisputed to a student
Or a thug wearing tennis shoes, Chuck Ts, and khaki suited
They all saluted. And true fans who run up to me
Congratulatin'. Upset haters who wanna boo me
Nothing can move me. I write tunes in LA
So you can groove to 'em from, like, June until May
Avenue the crew I'm from. Like who?
You faker than a toup√©e. Quit asking for my two-way, clown
Heated up is how we all get down Representing for the town
Killa-Cali, we don't mess around
So I gotta shout out to Snoo and C-Los
My homies from the 'hood 'cause they wrap tight as burritos
Everybody locked down from the Isle to Chino
I love you whether you white, brown, or Philipino
Get your C notes. They makin' it hard

[Hook: Ahmad]
Makin' it hard on me...
Pulling me over when I drive when I'm strictly legit'
Makin' it hard on me...
Be doing everything they can trying to get us to quit
Makin' it hard on me...
Whenever we doing a show we be hyping the spot
Makin' it hard on me...
4th Avenue is fittin' to blow whether you like it or not

[Verse 2: Tena Jones]
Got a feeling we fittin' to come up (why?)
'cause Tena been putting in work from when it set until it sun up
Studio bills run up on mixes and master DATs
One of the few women to master that
Hard rhyme, hard-hittin', Hip-hop hardcore
Got you open like a car door
On Look Alive, franchising like Motel 6 so leave the light on
Come with a hit soon as I get something to write on
The God in me won't let me quit I got to fight on
A street soldier so for my clique I give my right arm
It's the real-life gospel, truth has got 'em hostel
Mad at us turning youth into apostles
Originator, while you're whole crew's a fiasco
We on the move like the Dukes running from Roscoe
Tena Jones, hustlin', sho' can't beat
No half-steppin' 'cause ain't no plan B
They makin' it hard

[Hook: Tena Jones]
Makin' it hard on me...
Girls hatin' Tena Jones 'cause of how I get down
Makin' it hard on me...
Out on another world tour 'cause they likin our sound
Makin' it hard on me...
I really do it for the love; never did it for fame
Makin' it hard on me...
And they spin us in the club 'cause we makin' it bang

[Verse 3: Jabu]
Formulate a plan, intelligent man like Hannibal
Phenominal hooks, cunning instincts of a animal
I'm gunning you crooks, stunning you rooks, yelling "Avenue"
Been off the books and this year I'm off the planet. You
Haven't the slightest. Flow blow put out your lighters
At the height of success minus the stress. Pray He guide us
Don't hang with biters; they just waitin' to infiltrate
So I've come early waitin, wake up early to worry Satan
Pearly gate gleamin', never sleeping but stay dreamin'
California Jones make mistakes and fall even
We all leavin', pick-up ball and start breathin'
I'm sick of boot camps, sick of these troops bob-weavin'
And cuttin' left. All of a sudden it's sudden death
The game over. Nothing changed, we trained soldiers
In the heat of the battle; no dismantle, we don't disband
Squad's in position, what's the plan?
They makin it hard

[Hook: Jabu]
Makin' it hard on me...
They call me the Back-Boogie, I refuse to front
Makin' it hard on me...
Avenue got what you need and whatever you want
Makin' it hard on me...
Coming from the underground and we rippin' the spot
Makin' it hard on me...
Me and my crew gon' put it down if you with us or not

So rough, so tough, 4th Ave, baby...
So rough, so tough, 4th Ave, baby...
So rough, so tough, 4th Ave, baby...
So rough, so tough, 4th Ave, baby...

[Hook: All]
Makin' it hard on me...
Pulling me over when I drive when I'm strictly legit'
Makin' it hard on me...
Doing everything they can trying to get us to quit
Makin' it hard on me...
Whenever we doing a show we be hyping the spot
Makin' it hard on me...
4th Avenue is fittin' to blow whether you like it or not

Makin' it hard on me
Don't stop, y'all... don't stop, yall
Makin' it hard on me
C'mon... c'mon...
