I think about you everyday (You say I dont even call)
Fa sho I love you baby stay (But you dont me at all)
Dont want to let you slip away but (Seem like you ready to fall)
Hurry up get over it okay
Okay, cause I cant take this another day

[Chorus:]
What more can I say, make it okay
What more can I do, I said Im sorry
What more can I say, make it okay
What more can I do
Yeah, I did that, sorry, come on!

You got it together clean, Ms. Perfect
You aint never did a thing that's perfect
You wont admit it but you committed it
Behind the scene know what I mean, Ms. Perfect

Stop yelling dont wanna fight no Kung-Fu
Cause you got a skeleton Ive got one too
And if you dont tell it then its gon haunt you

[Verse 2:]
Dont say its over or were through
Baby, don't break us apart
'Cause you know I was down for you
Baby, you're breaking my heart
Girl, I admit I wasn't true
Let's try again from the start
Dont know what you want me to do
Girl, I dont know what you want me to do

[Chorus]

How many times did I not sweat you
How many times you cried I kept you
How many times you lied
I let you back again after then, ain't that true?
You ain't right you always fight though
You act like you might be psycho
Why I gotta walk the line like tightrope

[Rap: Tena Jones]
Should have told me the truth boy, freed your soul
Now you wanna cry like, "Please dont go"
You ain't right, aint like you gon' change
So I dont want to be no "we" no more
Lie about big, you'll lie about small
Lie about some folk? Lie about all
Lie about where you say you've been
All day when I didn't get no call

Girl do what you want to
I'd never hurt you, never hurt you its true
You're my everything
The centerpiece of anything I do, ooh ooh
And without you by my side I wont survive
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, don't go
