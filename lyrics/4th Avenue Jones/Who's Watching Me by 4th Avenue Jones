Scared, trapped my life has got to change
I won't complain
But I need some things
Lord I want a new life
I might die if you don't do something
Who'll be there for me when I cry

(Chorus:)
Who's watching me, when I was watching you
Sometimes I'm so confused
Feel like I've got nothing to lose
Who's watching me, when I was watching you
Sometimes I'm so confused
Feel like I've got nothing to lose
Who's watching me

(B Section)
Who watching, Who watching, Who watching me when I'm watching you
(Repeat 4x)

No one understands just how I feel inside
Thinking they know me but they don't
Cause' I don't even know myself
Lord I need a new life
I might die if you don't do something
Who'll be there for me when I cry

(Chorus & B Section)

They don't know
Who I really am
No they don't know, No they don't know
They don't know who I...
