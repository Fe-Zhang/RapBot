[Intro: Kev Roc]
On the outside, looking in, but be looking out.  Be on the outside, looking in, but be looking out.  Yeah.  Check it

[Verse 1: Kev Roc]
No feat to seize ya, feed ya my treatise, no broke
Ill beast or freezer thieving on the eve of my release
Pleasing, my seasonings appease your peace.  Kev Roc’ing
Steez, I’m fine like fleece, magnifique, Belize—muah!
My checkup is born to be bomb, I’ll make it the place to be
I’m fogging up the bakery glass from all the pastry
Connive I’m craving in, flowing La Rock from your chick toe
Digging my hooks deep down an industry fishbowl
Rebuff and suffer me, your ho’s sick.  Running back
I zap a chick, collapse, I beat a rap like O.J
Perimeter prison, a venom rhyme and time, I’ve been
Fiending as I grin

[Hook: Kev Roc]
Outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside

[Verse 2: Kev Roc]
The observer.  Like the sermons I serve, Kev flow be tapped, will figure the
Nerve of vermin woofing, unbeknownst they’re crap, type bugging
I seize the day, pack nickels to dime and sell it for trade and come back
The drama kid exhibit merely vomit on display
Severed, I’m cleft when rhyming, break out of death.  Kev Roc
I titillate, suck, then fuck as if a summer league ref.  If I need
The breath I breathe the seed of a demon, dope my device
Like fish and bread, come hold my basket, nigga, hope it suffice
My verbal elixir in my mixer and kicks ‘em back, jacks ‘em
When I throw bricks at them, I picks ‘em up, fix the flat, exact
The toll, edit the text, pack the roll, chill a Beck’s, scatter
My flows, stash the lira, crash your mirror, kill effect
Shocking like the vapors from a nugget as it exit
Clocking from, I gutted up a story like the Feds sit
Massaging on my lozenges, hot, true izm hock.  Kev Roc
A stranger in the dark as I watch from out the prism

[Hook: Kev Roc]
Vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside

[Interlude 1: Kev Roc]
Check it out

[Verse 3: Kev Roc]
Get pressy, punk, aggressive fuselage press your deficit
Ill verse of mine for cursed punk, I’ll push him off a precipice
Kev Roc a brother betwixt a hard place and Hell
Lace an L, space, I dwell with great taste and grace a gel
All hurts of mine be pertinent, forever ghetto-relevant
Inclined, Kev Roc a diamond, rock the climate and its element, and
Columns are follum, rhyme are seed for fertilizing beats
That reek, I stand fanning if the wise end herbalizer
Myopic, ill on topic, I envelop when Kev Roc
A Davy Jones’s Locker death, the lyrical development
From under come my thunder, bump precision, I pump style, no crime
Or dime in time for guzzling wine or rhyme denial.  From old
Storage, I’ll pull the file, count score, four ridge a tile, drop, score
Pass it to foul, I’ll push it through original and root
True, blue nigga youth, for real, off.  “Did he call?  Come meet
Me north.”  The Brinkerhoff, I’ll hit you off with seals and cross
I’m true to this, ambition to downflow, quote a patient, ill
Effect, hardened parcel of the speaker motivational
Kev Roc, I’ll break and shake a nick yet unbroken
With wicked will, my written word lethal when spoken

[Hook: Kev Roc]
Vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside
Looking in, vibing in, Darc Mind dive again
Fiending as I grin outside

[Outro: Kev Roc]
But be looking out.  Check it out.  We’re on the outside, looking in, but be looking out.  Matt Light, Scott Green, Nick Wiz be on the outside, looking in, but be looking out.  Of course, Getting Money Web D always be looking out.  Ah
