[Chorus]
The rhythm, the the the rhythm
Make you co-operate with the rhythm
(Repeat x4)

[Godfather don]
My mind is cloudy, nigga I wanna get rowdy
That's how we do shit, a few clips and then we outtie
Give me some room to get verbal and in vulgar
I got you thumpin' something like a hole in ya molar
Your pain is inflicted with shits from my scripts kick
I got you open, you peeps are scoping where my dick sits
All in ya knows why you pose like a faggot
It's like I shit it, the father did it, go ahead and grab it
Still on my tip for the technical fast flow
There ain't no cash, so, stay the fuck out my ass hole
Towards is the last song, so blessed on, with Teflon
With meth on my mind got left, shit, a fly couldn't catch on

[JuJu]
Fuck keepin' it real, I ain't jokin'
You bitch-ass niggas act hard and they still get their shit broken
Wilding is risky but it's fun
I'm on some ol' cowboy shit, give me some whiskey and a fucking gun
You watching niggas set it off son
I'll have all you niggas running like girls when I let off one
A little nigga going far, yo you know I'm a star
I got your wife, kid, sitting in my fucking car
Let them niggas try and curse mine
I heard niggas liked they comin' through the Island for the first time
Junkyard will represent, no doubt, 3CF mob, fuck the world and I'm out

[Chorus]

[Lord Finesse]
Check it I catch wreck when my mind's set
When it's time to get down I get around like nine etch
Give me your ring I can still swing my fuck
With these cornball rappers when you can have a real thing
So just cool it, I flow like fluid
Ain't nothing to it I keep it raw like sewage
Huh, brothers think they got my flow figured
But you can have a afro and slacks that don't mean you got soul nigga
Stand back, don't try to keep close
It's the Funky Man, Lord Finesse straight from the East coast
I can't hang, come on, picture that
I'm from Uptown, Boogie Down where rap was invented at
Matter of fact I'm out to stack figures
When I drop rhymes I make brothers go 'Yo who's that nigga?'
Fuck around you'll get your ass fried this ain't Pharcyde
I'm not someone nigga that you could pass by
Come on, you're rolling with a paid star
I keep my money in rolls just like my motherfucking braids are
No doubt, I got clout
I'm gonna say peace adios one love
Yo, I'm out

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, here comes the night time stalker
Who's swelling niggas' lips fatter than Jimmy Walker
The freestyler, nigga disquala
Fuck a bitch, you know I'm all about making dollars
Fat Joe, you know I been here before
Rap extraordinaire, always kicking shit raw
Motherfuckers know the flow is tight
Bagging hoes like the Puerto Rican Dolomite
Man listen, there's no competition
'Joe taking an L?'
Look nigga keep wishing
Fat Joe and you know how we do
Peace to Big Ed, and my nigga JuJu
Word

[Chorus]

[Bas Blasta]
Come fo' rough with the rhyme crew fresh
Bas Blasta words penetrate through flesh
Why not pay dues to earn props
You soundin' like my nigga
I'm not gonna pay I'm not
I'm comin' of okay, makin' rappers run like O.J
With a big clan, like the man who's named Jos√©
No way will the competitor
Get iller than the bloodspiller wild like predator
Straight to your brain is where I aim
When I start to inflict pain you will never be able to maintain
Insane with my manuscript
Rappers can't get with the way I'm kicking it
I can't stand a hypocrite
Who lies and tries to claim styles
He fails to rise with the mentality of a child
Bas got mad rhymes the party bounces
I need a notebook that weighs forty ounces

[Chorus]
