[Intro: Cassie]
So high
Don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so shy
I'm fucking with you

[Verse 1: Cassie]
I know what I want now, no shade, no hatin'
But if that's your date then you need a replacement
No shade, no hatin', no lines, no waitin'
Loud body language, no conversations
Just meet me in the back of the room
When I found out that you're here
I wanted to do it here, I think we should vacay
You can be my souvenir

[Chorus: Cassie]
Yeah, 'cause kissin' you was very nice
The rest of you is paradise
Got me shakin' like a pair of dice
Body rollin' like a pair of dice
I be fuckin' with him every night
Fuckin' with him every night

[Verse 2: Cassie]
I know what I want now, no wait, no patience
Don't trip, won't say shit, private location
No shade, no hatin', your girl can't say shit
Loud body language, no conversations
Just let me do whatever with you
Give me some, I'm not scared
Give it back, yeah, I'll share
Vacation at my place, I can be your souvenir

[Chorus: Cassie]
Yeah, 'cause kissin' you was very nice
The rest of you is paradise

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I walked in through the back, can’t go through the front
My engine go in the back, trunk go in the front
She was givin' me brains while I was rollin' one up
When I shoot it, I score, when I hit it, she jump
Don’t see no keys when I’m pullin' up Keys
When I'm folding up, peace, let it roll about Wiz
Started going over seas and rolling up trees
I’m buying it all, I don’t like to tease her
Oh, you ain’t heard? I’m in the game
And I ain’t on stage, darling, but scream my name
So the next step's we go get a plane
Then we fly to a place where don’t nobody know us
Then I’m gonna wait to say what you want
Then I’m going in for a taste, especially below your waist
I got a plan for the place, I got a band for the case
You tell me play my cards right
I got a hand full of aces
Fucking with you every night, body looking very tight
And um...

[Chorus: Cassie]
The rest of you is paradise
Got me shakin' like a pair of dice
Body rollin' like a pair of dice
I be fuckin' with him every night
Fuckin' with him every night

[Outro: Cassie]
Paradise
Got me shakin' like a pair of dice
Paradise
Got me shakin' like a pair of dice
The rest of you is paradise
