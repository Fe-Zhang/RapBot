[Intro: Denace]
Yeah... sometimes things happen man...
Guess out of our control...
And we just gotta deal with it
Farewell

[Hook: Denace]
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

[Verse 1: Denace]
Farewell miss, I know that you can't care less
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless
But I need you to know that I love you so much
And I've been drinking myself to sleep, my soul's crushed
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch
I was in love with you, how could you do this to me!?
Actually, I did this to myself, what a tragedy!
And now what do I do? Where do I go?
Cause everywhere I go I see your face
It's hard startin' over tryna find another shoulder
To lean on
I feel like my whole life just got peed on
They say time heals, but damn it I wanna stop time
And feel this pain as crazy as it sounds to me it's sane
And I like it, why? Cause I feel like we're still united
In some weird way, I don't wanna fight it!

[Hook: Denace]
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

[Verse 2: Denace]
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back
It's like that!? After all the crap, we've been through!?
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!
You keep sending me to voicemail
I'm annoyed, hell! Shit you coulda atleast sent a text
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!
You're hardheaded, a sharp headache, I need help call a medic!
I just cut myself, yeah I did it
Without you I'm nothing, don't you get it!?
Everytime that I said I loved you I meant it
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that
You're so cold, you just hit me so low
I can't take this no more, so hit the road

[Hook: Denace]
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight

[Bridge: Denace]
Some things just don't seem the way they do
One day you tell me 'I love you and only you'
I wake up to find out it was a dream
You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me
People change, everything changes
We go from best friends then become strangers
We go from seeing eachother everyday then
Farewell, to never seeing your face again

[Verse 3: Denace]
I can't get you out of my head
So I'm out of my bed at four in the morning wishin'' I was dead
But for some odd reason I can't do it
For some reason I needed to write what's on my mind
And what's going through it
Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate
Why do you have so much hate
Towards me? You need some loving babe
God I fuckin' love you, I hate myself
For fallin' in love with you
Just to find out all I did was trouble you
My heart is aching, I'm medicating
I tried meditating, but nothing works I don't even feel sedated
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second
I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked
Fuck humiliation, you would do anything to get me back
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves, good
And do everything to have me, if you could

[Hook: Denace]
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight
I don't wanna say goodbye but sometimes
Things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight
