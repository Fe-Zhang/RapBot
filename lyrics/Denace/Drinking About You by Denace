[Intro]

Yeah, lately I've been feeling kinda weak
And I'm not the type to be weak
I don't know

No one's gonna love you like I do, no
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Verse]

I can't stop thinking about her, I can't believe I'm without her
It's hurting deep in my soul, my heart can't scream any louder
I can't conceive the fact we won't see each other
I can't convince myself it's over neither

It's over Denace
No, I don't believe her
I won't let it go, I won't just just leave her
I won't, I know I gotta fight to keep her

If I gottta walk through fire, climb the highest mountain to see her
Counting the avalanches that I'll encounter to be there
I'ma do it to prove that she shouldn't have doubted me either
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make her happy to please her
So she can see that I'm serious, I wanna find her and squeeze her

I never thought it be over
I guess the problem was me or the timing was off
I guess I couldn't complete her
I guess that love ain't enough
I guess my love just depleted

All the crying and screaming
All the fighting of demons
All the trust out the window and the memories bleeding

[Hook]

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[2nd Verse]

I never cried this much since I was five or six
I feel like I'm a bitch cause my minds a rut
My friends keep telling me to leave you behind
And all these memories are haunting me, I'm hitting rewind

Ugh constantly, constant on my mind you be
It seems to be your face just follows me around this town
I'm probably gonna lose my minds psychology
I think you owe me an apology
But probably not gonna get one, no?
Cause that's  just the way you let them go

You never take fault
It's never your fault
I'm always in the wrong
But you've never been caught
But I know someone else has your heart

I don't belong in this relationship
And plus I don't have a place to sit
Someone else better take a pic, I just faded quick
Man, I hate this shit cause I know that no one's gonna love you like I do (like I do)

I bet you, your're gonna meet someone in the long run
You're gonna fall in love with the wrong one
He's gonna love you I won't deny it
But their not gonna love you like I did

[Hook]

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Verse 3]

I can't sleep, I can't talk
Damn it I pulled the last straw
I'm swerving in my fast car, your pictures in my dashboard
I'm ready to leave, no escort
Where I'm going you don't need a passport
I'm ready to die, depressed I'm alive
Packing my things and saying my goodbyes

I'm missing you, no denying that
I'm writing you, you ain't writing back
I'm fighting for you, you ain't fighting back
There's not enough spark to light a match!

So what do I do?
I'm stuck here thinking of you, drunk here
Drinking this bru, this is what happened for fucking with you

Never cried this much for another bitch, cunt
Debating if should I cut both my wrists up
But I don't wanna be another victim

Not gonna wait for help to get picked up
Not gonna lie to you, this shit it gets tough
Man, I miss her so much
And I wish I could do anything that I can to fix up whatever mess that I managed to kick up

I misunderstood, what a mix up
This split up has me split up
I'm waiting by the phone for your call
So I can pick up and tell you that I love you
And I miss you so much
But that's never gonna happen, our relationship sunk

[Hook]

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Outro]

No one's gonna love you like I do (like I do)
No one's gonna feel like I do (like I do)
