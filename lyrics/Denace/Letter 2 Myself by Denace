[Hook]
Imagine all the people living for today

[Verse 1]
I wanna write you, yeah you
The guy behind the pen, writing this song, reciting it again
I never liked you, cause you was never like me
You was always trying to impress others like fuck it, just bite me
But deep down your soul is crushing inside me
And all I can think of is what really really defines me
Your true self is something you can't deal with
So you put up a front, walk around like you don't feel shit
And ass-faking, I don't like it, I despise it
So be real with yourself as I write this
And then it might just sink right into your mind sense
You're losing people around you, can't find friends?
Of course you can't, you're hard headed
Too smart for your own good, a sharp headache
Most people hate you, you're like five Simons in one Dennis
Do you hear me, huh, Denace?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't like the fact that you keep me hidden
On top of that, you're an act just to fit in
This ain't really what I wanted for you, not my vision
Your friends made you what you are, really think I'm kidding?
Listen D, you're drowning me inside this misery
Maybe if you didn't lock me inside like you did to me
I wouldn't hurt you if you didn't keep on hitting me
By bottling everything inside, are you sick of me?
Well I am sick of you, this is why I pick at you
Look at you, look inside this fucking mirror and tell me
That it ain't clear that you're alone and you can't bear
The fact that everyone around you is going somewhere
And you're stuck here dazed with a blank stare
Your stress is killing you, is that a grey strand of hair?
Watch as life passes by as you're standing there
In line at the hospital waiting for medicare

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
As you sit there and you're writing on this third verse
I manifest in symptoms to show you that I hurt worse
I'm giving you exactly what you're giving me
You wanna live then you gotta start living free
You gotta be yourself, put aside that someone else
Take the mask off and deal the hands that you were fucking dealt
Don't be ashamed of the person that you are
Don't be so tense and strung up like this guitar
You're having an identity crisis
Come on, get a grip Denace, you got me in you, let's fight this
Dr. Jekyl, mister don't go and hide this
We can do it together, come on, fight bitch!
Come on and bring me out and keep me out
For people to see me now, this is what it's about
Come on the time is now so stop hiding out
Pop the cork or break the fucking bottle now!
