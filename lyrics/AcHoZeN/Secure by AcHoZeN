[Verse 1: RZA]
Achozen, many shall come
Few shall be chosen (chosen)
Achozen
Achozen
We are highly capable
We are secure
Secure
Arm leg, leg arm head
We come to resurrect the mentally dead
Bong
Ain’t no breakin’ me, ain’t no shakin’ me
Y’all must’ve mistaken me for someone else
Gun strapped to the holster
32 gold bullets encased in the shell
Eight-point star on my chest
The badge of honor
Brave, I wave the flag of my father
Conquering Lion of Judah from Zion to Bermuda
Two triangles, I’m a cross right through you
I’m the ruler
Six points of man, pituitary gland and the medulla
Secrete the hormones
I can peep into the future
Allah’s chosen
In this jungle of the urban wilderness
Of North America is the holy cross carrier
Crack the sound barrier
Highly capable, there’s no escaping us
Ain’t no breaking me
Yo, Shavo!

[Bridge: Shavo Odadjian]
Allyo! Achozen

[Verse 2: RZA]
On that midnight train to Georgia
It’s ust me and Portia
In the cabin is sexual torture
I thought I taught ya
Love will keep us together
Things will get better but I ran out of cheddar
*Muah* to your kiss down to your esophagus
I transform like Optimus or Rodimus Prime meridian
Blown to oblivion
Poison pen, killer bee back none slithering
Now we got you trembling
Running so fast lost you and your Timberland
I got you, remember when
Wu Tang Clan had the whole party glimmerin’
Now you shakin’ and shiverin’
A-C-H-Ozen
Rose to the top but you are frozen
But we Achozen
Glamorous sandalwood and honeysuckle lamb spread
From California to Hempstead
Elegant damsel with extravagant lingerie
Ah, face like Monterey
Cambodia straight down to Santa Fe
Now what can I say?
Half a mill in sterling, another in euros
It’s the American hero

[Verse 3: RZA]
Thought I had a surprise for them
I made them sing like the auditorium
Four shells, took out all four of them
24/7 like the food emporium
From the zoo to the fields of Astoria
Shaolin Rock come the hip-hop warriors

[Bridge: Shavo]
Warriors come out and play

[Verse 4: RZA]
I’m not complete without a day
Yo, law out of order
Zoom in with these camcorders
Watch what these perverted artists do to a man’s daughter
He was out to snort a key, not a gram shorter
I pioneer the frontier like Charles Ingalls, Laura
Had MPV’s, the Grand Explorers, and Chryslers
The Humvees, the blue Taurus
The G5s and I’m sitting on quarters
Slipping through the block with those S dot-carters
Wallabies if I wanna plex harder
Come follow me if you wanna get a part of
Money in my socks, dummy on the blocks
Actin’ funny with the cops
You do the bunny hop
Over fences I’m cunning with the Glock
On the drive down the block
With the drop town down
License suspended
Brass on my lap
Female passenger on my side and I’m playing with her cat
