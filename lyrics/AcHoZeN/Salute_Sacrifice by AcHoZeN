[Verse 1: Reverend William Burke]
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in a briefcase
Jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait
Reverend William Burke's mind in a deep space
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in a briefcase
Jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait
Reverend William Burke's mind in a deep space
We creates at a G's pace
For heaven's sake and for goodness grace
We burn fakes at the stakes
Throw your hands in the sky
And wave 'em from side to side
Drunk funk and skunk for getting crunk to ride
And let me hear you holla homicide
She was murdered on the dance floor
More cash in the register drawer
My whole crew pay our rent from the score
We go to war for the pure, for sure
To add even more law to the thought of a cure
A hula hoop was 360 degrees
Shiny afro blow in the breeze
Used to scoop shaboobaloop in the coop from the greens
Between her jeans, all through to gold women in teams
They get it down for the cream
I help achieve they dream

[Verse 2: Shavo]
Check this shit out...
22 frames a second
Paradigm shift shocks
Sword swings, swift slice, serious sounds
Spectacular shine, cypher supreme, cypher divine
A curious mind, a furious rhyme
Sustain strange slopes, sacrifice slip storyline
Sip scotch, sigh eye
Stimulate, strike, sonic, and sudden
Sophisticated souls stay stainless
Salute, spit, swap, spine, subtle, severe
Snow blind, subliminal signs
Speculate sick superficial stereotypes
Stereotypical skeptics
Septics, ‘cept swine
Skeptic sick septics sick spiritual spindle
Spank, curious, sick, sonic, sick, super, sick
Stereo, sick, syndrome
Stay stainless, sip Scotch
Sophisticate, sip sacrifice syndrome
Stay stainless, sip Scotch
Sophisticate, sip sacrifice

[Hook: Shavo]
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[Verse 3: The Reverend William Burke]
Krispy Kremes in the suitcase, laser beams in the briefcase
Onion rings for the cheapskates
Diamond rings on the finger of my baby cakes
Achozen few, we only plays for the high stakes
Series of silver, swindling service
Decipher the subtle signals
The spinner spindling yard on the spool
A student who too cool for school in a see Allah Rule
Dropping a jewel on this educated fool
Simulated sonar signals, space symbol, severe civil rivalries
Split brothers and sisters
Twisters and blizzards, blow the gizzards out of lizards
We sizzle wizards, ninjas, gold dentures, trenches

[Hook: Shavo]
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[Verse 4: Kinetic 9]
Supposed I stayed in school and somewhat studied 
Sports and succeeded student
Instead I would slack skip sleep
Slapped on the scalp from Sr
Soon to be sent survive streets
Man I was stupid straight up sick
Shouted Supreme 
The story
Surreal the scene 
A soldier stay strapped with the sub machine 
Send a shot subtract ya 
Stretched out on the sidewalk
Had to be scraped with a spatula
Like shit stuck to the skillet 
My skill so sick so I must say 
So what if you second sucka

[Hook: Shavo]
Sacrifice

[Verse 5: RZA]
OK K K
Kill cutlery knives, kill conniving kinsmen
Kid crazy cuckoo corrupt kiddy kittens
Kicking on, committing criminal capers
Cutting Klansmen kid
I blow Kurtis cube kite to Kansas
Cranium like acts of Ben Kingsley
They cause brain cells to snap, crackle, and pop
Like Kellogg’s Krispies, colliding kaleidoscopes
Cause visual collisions
Captain Caveman, want Colonel chicken
Cookies in a rock, Obama like Barack
OK-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-Z-A, stop
Super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
Soak sweet Sandra’s sheets still they sexy and steaming
Still, slick, majestic, special sessions in S’s
Snatch Superman’s socks while metropolis stresses
Simply superior statements of slang Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum left your brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra-s-s-sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sa-- I said, I said
I said super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
I soak sweet Sandra’s silky sheets till she steaming
Still, slick, majestic, special sessions in S’s
Snatch Superman’s socks while metropolis stresses
Simply superior statements of slang Staten Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, leaves your brain stained
Sacrifice, s-s-s-sacrifi--
