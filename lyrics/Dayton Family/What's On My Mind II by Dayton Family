Yeah, I want to dedicate this song to Jonathan Myers
Morris Peterson, Gemini Smith, and Matthew Hinkle
What's on yo mind?

[Shoestring]
No demonstration on this nation, as a murderfest
Got us locked in the jailcell, the others they was put to rest
I had no teacher, it was like my pops had passed away
Bought me a sweet and snapped his fingers, he was gone away
My house is hell, I used dwell down there on ?Acre? street
Whole hood on ADC, pops in penetentiary
Caught in the system, he's a victim of his shorty's past
His son's a killa on the for reala, you best to watch yo stash
What's on my mind, is my brotha named Rodney King?
Coulda been Shoestring, instead the devil chose Malice Green
Can't go to sleep, not too deep cause I be hearin shots
Down on my block bodies drop, it'll never stop
The ghetto drama for yo mama is a wicked sin
God save her soul, don't wanna say it but my mom's a fiend
Stand in the rain, can't take the pain, the stress is kickin in
Mack's in the pen cause it was all about his dividends
Life was a struggle, had to hustle, and sometimes buckle
A swollen knuckle, lockin up was the ghetto couple
Out to get rich, but I'm no snitch, no need to drop a dime
My future's blind, now tell me what's on yo mind

Chorus: Tell me, tell me, what's on yo mind? (2X)
(What's on my mind, what's on my mind
Was it the chrome, too ??? the crime?)

[Bootleg]
Apply the pressure, drastic measures made the victim's fall
One shot to the head, before they fled, they made em beg and crawl
Can't stop the thunder in my mind, so who controls the storm?
I fill my body full of drank and dank to keep it warm
Please stop the killin, Lord a killa's what I've grown to be
My mind's on murder God, homicides are all I see
Please set me free from all the enemies that haunt my mind
Why do the righteous, poor, and black suffer all the time?
My mother talks to me, and tells me, "Stop the violent killin"
Workin hard all day, tryin to make my pay
Now how you think I'm feelin?
What's on my mind, it's sad, look so small in kid's faces
Knowin their daddy's doin 20 for some drug cases
Never knew my daddy so I never could respect a man
Learned to cook up drugs and hold my ground while other yougsters ran
Gotta be a man, so my plan is to pursue my dreams
My family's gotta eat so I'm gon keep on feedin fiends
Know what I mean, the same routine almost everyday
Law's pushin me, so I'm gon keep on stackin hay
Out to get rich, but I'm no snitch, no need to drop a dime
My future's blind, now tell me, what's on yo mind?

Chorus (2X)

[Ghetto E]
Try to stop these fires, but they got me trapped inside the fence
Wanna represent his death, cause murder's what I'm up against
It makes no sense to me, the troubles that run through my head
Wakin up in the mornin, knowin the grave might become my bed
I shoulda fled, but from my problems, I can't get away
No matter when or where I go, they're with me everyday
I'm shootin the dice and drinkin the liquor to set my mind free
And tryin to find a piece of my mind, where problems can't find me
No matter what, I'm stuck, my mind is trapped inside the sin
So I release my anger through a chamber, gin, a pad, and pin
Your so called friends
Ain't really your friends because they don't stay true
Besides the smokin and drinkin, now tell me, are they there for you?
Cash or credit, gotta get it, can't be po no mo
Some gangstas roll into the heaven's say no roll no mo
Out to get rich, but I'm no snitch, no need to drop a dime
My future's blind, now tell, me what's on yo mind?
