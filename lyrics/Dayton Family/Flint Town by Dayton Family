What's up
If you from Flint
Get out ya seat
Get up of your ass
Drink your brew and smoke that grass
We fixin to rock from Pontiac to LANSING back to Saginaw to Detroit
And take over in every club
Bootleg, Shoestring, and the muthafuckin Backstabba
Ehh, we gonna do it like this

I'm sayin what's up to the muthafuckin flintstone thugs
Just drink your brew and smoke that bud
Three off muthafucka's from around the way
If you not from Flint than you get no play
I go to Lucky's, Ditty Boys, and to Charlie C's
I go to skate in CLC cause it's in a mix
I like drinkin at the Vets Hammer Droppers, too
TDF is in this bitch cause we da boys from the avenue
Maniac Lunatic and you know that I'm tellin it
Bitch's head in my way, you know that I'm swirlin it
So all you punks take your weak ass to school
Be calm and cool don't be no fool
I'm talkin north and northwestern, and central too
K.C. and Joyce we gonna rock for you
I'm sayin peace to my homies a Whether B
Fred Dogg S P double E D Y cause that's my type of guy
DeWalt Evans and BigJ Ski into the muthafuckin job done by my boy Joe B
Seaten Hall is in the house and Dayton is too
Wesely is down, cause it's in Flint town
So all you Flint muthafuckas listen to what I say
Throw you hands in the air hooray hooray
I'm sayin peace to my brother and my sista too
I'm sayin peace to the Heinkle's and the Dorsey's crew

(chorus)
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town

My name is Ira Dorsey
Let my name be known
I'm the man thats killin bitches
Leaving stitches in nigga's domes
Flint is clossin in on me
But still I'm not friendly
The trama in my life
Through different phases, it sends me
I grew up as a shorty knowin broke wasn't cool
Now I got a workin girl in almost every high school
Pump this in your Nissans, beamers, and trucks too
And if your not from Flint then it's like straight up fuck you
The city that I'm from is just a dot on the map
Where dope houses get robbed and most of the clubs ????? (dem shouts)
Michael Jackson said it don't matter black or white but it should
Cause Flint Michigan's a long way from Hollywood
I tried to go to college but I saw myself stuck in Flint
Beside them college folks don't want no po male black resident
Flint Michigan's a prison and we all are locked up
The only good jobs are the jobs that could be rocked up
Refused to work for Burger King and still be livin po
How can you work for Burger King an live in a condo
My city's being fuck by your system, that's evident
Puts bullets in a brother at a club back to ignorent
Special shouts to big boomer, personal autograph
And shouts to all those niggas I forgot down on Dayton Ave
There's one more thing you should know before I go with the sound
Who the fuck is ya'll to tell Breed not to leave this town

(chorus)
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town

Flint is dominated
But never immatated
The others perpatrated
But still we regulated
The Dayton Family is a nation
To build a new creation
To take a vacation that is an occupation
Flint ho's is steady sackin
Flint nigga's steady jackin
Them fiend's is stead crackin
Some pimp's is steady mackin
Some homies chasin Jason
Them cops is steady macin
Just because he's basin
Many years this nigga facin

No money so you lootless
No cain so you tootless
No food in your digestive system so your booty pootless
But niggas wearin dickies, but some are bein picky
They see me in my packas and these bitches wanna lick me
Groove to the sounds of the TDF
Takin ova like rova till there's no time left
On stage in a rage
We might get payed
We can tell you where we're from but not our age
From the F to the L to the I-N-T
To the D-A-Y-T-O-N A-V-E
So just shake your body and don't you quit
Other cities say they're number one, but that's hoeshit

(chorus)
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
