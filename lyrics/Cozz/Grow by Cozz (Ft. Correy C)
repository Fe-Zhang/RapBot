[Intro: Cozz]
Yeah, one for the—
Yeah
Shit
I'm fucked up, man—nah, not really, I ain't

[Verse 1: Cozz]
Look;
I went from a hobby rapper to a nobody can stop me rapper
After I put my mind to it
I looked at the bar, went right through it
It's quite easy, but you quite stupid
Niggas be self-made foolish for views in the comments
We only shooting for the comets
I keep the faith on my waist and the truth in my pocket
How the fuck we gon' lose with a crew full of prophets
Got nothin' to prove to you dudes who just talking
I'd rather get my dick sucked, I'd rather get my balls licked
Dick covered in Loreal, but I still couldn't make up
A better story to tell than mine
I was born in the dark so all I want is the shine
I'm so for real, so I can't help you
No for real I couldn't wear ice creams, never get cold feet
Oh me, oh my, Cody, that's one of a kind
It's just an optimist that out of his prime
I'm tryna climb a ladder that's better than yours
I'm tryna find a pain that I can't endure
Cause everybody goes through pain, that thing is for sure
So I'm tryna find a pain that I can't endure
That's what I'm saying
I'm starting to think I shouldn't be cool with niggas
I'm starting to think I should just get rude with niggas
It seems like that's the way to get respect
Unless you get a check that proves you get it
What the fuck I gotta prove to niggas? Nada
Yeah I'm straight, I won't even drop the soap in water
When I do to dishes, yeah that pussy too delicious
I wouldn't ditch school for bitches, such a foolish Christian
But Jesus running through my jeans, that's my True Religion
I'm such a Christian
But at the same time this religion has me ditchin' my mission
It's gonna make more than a pension
What's ten dollars to a million? Is you with it?
But at the same time this religion
Has me ditchin' my mission
That's gon' make me more than a pension
Ten dollars, what's that to a million? Tell me is you with it?
I'm all about growth

[Hook: Correy C]
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
I had to grow up on 'em baby
I'm bout to blow up on 'em baby
I never slow up on 'em baby
I'm quick to grow up on 'em baby

[Verse 2: Cozz]
My pops used to leave ten dollars in cash before I went to class, every day
I used to spend five dollars on the weed and 40 ounce with the other half, every day
Starving myself for the hunger of a buzz
I wonder what it was that had me drowning my liver and fuckin' up my lungs
That pride and ego could blind the people
They tell you what you need to hear
Bitch you never minded like we ain't equal
Oh you got it, you know it all, whatever nigga
There's a place of trouble for those who talk but never listen
Let me tell you something
I am young but I get it, I am young but I'm gettin' it
I am not like y'all
I grew like two years over the fall
I grew like five years over the summer, no wonder I'm so smart
And see right through your crazy, fugazy talk
Fuck these parties, fuck these hoes
Nigga I'm just tryna grow
I'm 'bout growth

[Hook: Correy C]
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
I had to grow up on 'em baby
I'm bout to blow up on 'em baby
I never slow up on 'em baby
I'm quick to grow up on 'em baby
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
Growth, growth, growth, growth
I had to grow up on 'em baby
I'm bout to blow up on 'em baby
I never slow up on 'em baby
I'm quick to grow up on 'em baby
I'm bout to blow up on you baby
