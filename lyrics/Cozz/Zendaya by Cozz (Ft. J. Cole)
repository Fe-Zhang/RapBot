[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Check

[Chorus: J. Cole]
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Listen, music my flesh and blood, it's been my only love since ye high
I used to play Jay high and Ye high
Thinkin' one day I would go from fan to fuckin' player
I guess I found a way huh, my nigga Cozz wants Zendaya
A side note, I'm rootin' for you, I use these bars and start recruitin' for you
But treat her right
And just remember, on your lonely nights this mic will be your friend
You tell it all your secrets that you keepin' deep within
Your fantasies, regrets, your happy moments and your sins
And if he doesn't comprehend, at least he can pretend
Let's begin to be the men we never seen
In the 80's they smoke crack but now today they sippin' lean
And poppin' Xannies
Fuck niggas runnin' from their families
The streets don't give a fuck about the Grammys
Wish I could talk to granny, wish I could smoke in peace
But when I hit the blunt lately my mind it tortures me
Everything ain't supposed to be, apparently
I take it as a sign and stick the shit that's steerin' me
In the direction of some clarity
This music is my therapy, I thank the Lord 'cause he care for me

[Chorus: J. Cole & Cozz]
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
You know I gotta thank God
How else I make it this far? (Far)

[Verse 2: Cozz]
Music is my soul and fuel
I guess it only saves a chosen few
From goin' to school or sellin' dope, crazy
Back in school, I was bumpin' Cole daily
Now I'm writin' rhymes in the notebook that Cole gave me
And bro you so crazy, but all I can do is thank you
You threw your boy a lob, and shit, I ain't even say to
But fuck it, all that shit he say true
'Cause you a dime, I'm sure you hear that every day, cool
So look, fuck bein' fine 'cause I know you got a brain too
And shit, let me not get my plate full, you know your brain moves
A little different when you haven't ate food
So I'ma leave it up to fate to make these decisions
And stick to my intentions
I did it for more of the passion, not the great checks
Knowin' that there's more than fat asses and great sex
Tryna be the man I ain't yet
But demons stuck on me like ashes on gray sweats
'Cause man I ain't made shit and I'm lackin' the patience
It's a battle to take in' the fact that I ain't win, yet
What am I sayin', I can't complain when
I travel and take trips, I look to God then I thank Him

[Chorus: Cozz]
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
Yeah, how else I make it this far?
How else I make it this far?
You know I gotta thank God
How else I make it this far? (far)

[Verse 3: Cozz]
Look, I ain't got money to blow but I'm gettin' there, dawg
Can't get momma a home but I'm gettin' there y'all
Won't reach the end of the road, just sittin' there dawg
How you gon' learn to grow if you ain't listenin' y'all?
Look, I'm still a student of the game but I been through some things
And I could school you at this age don't be clueless in the brain
You gotta learn to fly before you cruisin' with the planes
And you could be a boss, just gotta do it in your lane
Choosin' and choose to pray instead of choosin' prey
To use and abuse for pay
You doin' it for the love or you doin' it to get praised?
What would you do for fame?
If it was family or money, they probably lose you today
Probably go buy a car and try and coupe with the pain
Sometimes homies and hoes is truly the same
Try and screw you for change, yeah it's truly a shame
But somehow I seem to see the beauty in the rain
I made it this far
