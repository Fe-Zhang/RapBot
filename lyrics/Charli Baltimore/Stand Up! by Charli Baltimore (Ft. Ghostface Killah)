[Intro: Ghostface & Lyn Collins samples]
Be friends wit'cha gram
I want everyone to stand up and be counted tonight
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*
Now clap ya hands and say “Yeah“ (Yeah)
Tune my voice up, tune my mic up
Tune my voice up, tune my mic up
Yo, this is how we rock
One, two, three
This is how we rock
This is how we rock, rock
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*
Yeah, we in the joint, yo, we in the joint
Hey yo, hey, yeah, scream
Hey now, I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
Ah shit
I want everyone to stand up and be counted tonight
Stand up, yeah
Brothers and sisters, if you know you've got your thing together
Put your muthafuckin’ hand in the air
I want you to stand on up
Now I got something to tell ya
Swing it from left to right
I'll tell you, now that I think about it
And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together
Yeah, play with this, you can't play with this
Come on now, get a groove going
Uh, yeah
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*

[Verse 1: Charli Baltimore & Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo
Yo, Tony, what up? Heard your dick was good
You should know, yo, I fucked you on the side of my hood
Never that dawg from where you can never hit it
Throw a razor in my mouth on the low and suck ya dick wit' it
The world famous, priceless, steel stainless dick
Pray over this, sculpture of love, name this
Heavyweight dick in ya jaw, good lickin’ from ya lips
Now babygirl throw the song Yo, yo, yo
Aye-yo, Tony, you phony, we both signed to Sony
But for half ya pub, ride that dick like a Pony, what
Yeah, what, put your money on my dick
Girls, all eyes on my dick

[Verse 2: Charli Baltimore]
Yo, yo, yo
Cats fatigued out, thinkin’ they armies
My crew arms me with beats, how we swarm bee?
Who bang? B’More and Wu Tang, new thang
Mad at how we do thangs, RZA copped me two fangs
Official, now I bite through gristle
Gold teeth style in from Philly to Staten Island
While in the meantime, spit mean lines
Fuck clean rhymes, like mine's grimy, like my niggas be
Picture me, coming off soft, ya’ll just cough up shit
I swallow rhymes, makin’ bitches swallow 9’s
Redefine this rap shit, make my shit a classic
Like Beethoven, stay posin’ for the camera
Stamina, like a crackhead, and crackheads are amateurs
You try me, no in-between like Y to Z
Pick brains like lobotomies still thoughts to charts of Billboards
Throw pour ill spores, leave niggas stiff like still-born's

[Interlude: Charli Baltimore, Lyn Collins samples, (Ghostface Killah)]
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
What, what, what
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Stand up baby, stand up baby
Brothers and sisters, if you know you've got your thing together
I want you to stand on up
(Stand up, yo)
Now I got something to tell ya
I’ll tell you, now that I think about it
Yeah, what, what, what
And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I’m like Spider-Man, fifth brother up in the Clan
Drop like crack that’s scattered all up in ya van
Skelly-man crook, character star in Donald Goines book
MGM, Heaven and Hell, sat with the cook
With the big spice bone, red hairs is killin’ it
Knotted up, twisted and green, see them crystals in it?
Rap Yogi Berra, bear hug and five hundered ounce
Of that Staision, wild man, Sarah
Rush after hours, Alfred in the Batcave
Hands like Dai Smith, rap Hagler with a fade
Magilla, Charli Baltimore witch hazel drip
From your drawers, when faced off with the Killah
Stood still, a whole river chill
Looked up, it got dark, that’s when RZA started to build

[Interlude: Lyn Collins samples]
Hey yeah, I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
Hey yeah, I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah, (Charlie Baltimore)]
(What, what, what, what)
Aye yo, you praise me, turtleneck nigga rockin’ Paisley
Shots crazily, steady blazin’ where the spades be
Teams like Starsky and Hutch, Super deluxe truck
Ya bankrupt, 52’s Knox, I heard you Ku Klux, damn
Tear it out the van, sweat it with a tan
Wicked like Remo spray can, Sugar Duran
Fuck a cocktail, get my balls licked in Hell
Read his Igloo Tales, hell all the dogs with broken tails
Salt range, Salt-Water taff, Ironman
Bubble bath, nucleus, split the atom in half
Meet damoes, fifth brother bug inside 8 pole
Change though, crush the birds inside shrimp rolls

[Verse 5: Charli Baltimore]
Yo, yo, yo
Rap Conspiracy, hold songs for ransom
Lancin’ in Ghostmode, coke mixed with Branson
Sheisty, tree's soaked in half-ki’s
Sabotage N.Y. with snipe’s and 79’s
Channel 9’s scene street team made news
With who’s Charli, every 16 bars be
Sickening, peep the scription, rhyme vixen
Keep the clips in tact, watch ya back
Ain't done yet, ain't spun yet, poison web is
Spider-Woman, two legged, how we did it
What!

[Outro: Lyn Collins samples]
Come on and get a groove goin’!
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*
Hey you, blow your whistle *Whistle sound*
Now clap your hands and say “Yeah” (Yeah)
Now let me count it off
One, two, three
Hey, hey-hey-hey yeah
I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
