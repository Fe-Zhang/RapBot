[Intro]
Word

[Verse 1]
My crew's official, D.S. two-triple
Hard like tittie nipples, venomous shells'll flip you
Hit you wit the super bionic
Lyrical boom like sonic
You better boss spectatin', the steadier you tryin' ta rhyme wit
My verbal serum's toxic
When I grip mic's are rockin', ta preach like a prophet
Fuck your head up wit different topics that let you know
Where I'm comin' from, and the outcome be somethin' catastrophic
Makin' you think it nucker, I'm a ill motherfucker
The type you can feel brother, slash cats that no clever
I'm undercover like double-o, wit trouble y'all
Be whatever-whatever, I'm nice wit it all
Whatever you yak and broad hitted on
Now it's time ta get rid a y'all
And some of y'all been playin' too much in the playa's ball
My fangs sharper than razor's, and spit words like Azor's
That'll leave your view deja
My vemous squads major
You minor league niggas can bite my dick as a favor
You tossed in the clutches of Cobra world
My gift is nice, you rip, I'll slice
I blaze the game precise, you niggas play the game wit dice

[Verse 2]
I got an arsenal large enough ta arm a whole army
You can take your best shot and not die the fit even harm me
Your bombs be like duds, not big enough ta make me budge
While I launch a scud miss-ile
Pack 4-4 pis-tiles
Wit unlimited clips
That's unlimited lyrics
Meanin' I can rhyme forever
Drop of a dime or whenever
For better or for worse I marry hip hop, no divorce
Around time whores can take my respect by force
If I have to, I'll subtract you from the game
You won't look the same, your own moms won't even know your name
Step on the plain, hard terrain, 4 wheels and rugged
What's the point of packin' a gat if you afraid ta bust it?
Original thug shit, I cut quick and axe later
We can rhyme for a small wager or figures that's mad major
Put your life on the line, we see who leaves the scene breathin'
I'll crush tha weak links, I do ya mad, hug it even

[Chorus]
Yo we ain't scared of none of y'all, we can brawl for this
So far we the only niggas sparkin' shit
D.S
We can put this whole thing ta rest
Poisnic age, gauge tha chest like Wild West

[Verse 3]
Yo you got five seconds ta clear out for mine
Cuz three-sixty-five I'm live as tha skydive
Notify your local authorities of these
Venomous degenerates spreadin' disease
Your man said: if you can fuck wit me that's a lie
He tryin' get you, probly wanna see me split you
Wanna see me chew you the fuck up and spit you
One of us be wipin stupid ass clean like tissue
Hit you wit a lyrical patriot missle
Drown you and your goons in the black lagoon
Durin' the full moon, we ambush amateurs
Leave fang marks on weak squads like yours
Time for war, you got troops? bring 'em all
This might not be a game, but I'm still tryin' ta score
That's why competetors ain't tryin' ta dance
My advance'll leave cats piss in they pants

[Verse 4]
Man if they hated me before, they bound ta hate me now
Cuz I gripped a couple dollars and be puttin' it down
Surround sound, double-o wit a 6 on the back
V-12 on the side, poppin' bottles of yak
We cockin' 'em back, the metal gat, you runnin' your mouth
We gunnin' you out, slugs leave you numb on the couch
We crossin' you out, you niggas betta change your tone
My range is long, can't you see you lookin' at chrome?
Dig the scene, bubble 'bout ta snatch tha cream
In this rap shit them niggas only half of this scheme
Every part of your team 'gon find it harder ta scream
These bitches love 'em, cuz when the gold spotted it gleams
Niggas wanna see me slip so they can take it to me
Cuz they bank account look like they rappin' for free
Practically, pennies while we jugglin' C's
Rugged in 3's, the chain in the piece we freeze
Shorten your speech, Reese'll make you strip in the streets
And we the reasons why you ain't seen your bitch in a week
We holdin' the heat, for all them niggas thinkin it's sweet
It's gonna end at the bridge and me cementin' your feet

[Chorus]
Yo we ain't scared of none of y'all, we can brawl for this
So far we the only niggas sparkin' shit
D.S
We can put this whole thing ta rest
Poisnic age, gauge your chest like Wild West

[Outro]
D.S. two-trip
Bust your muthafuckin' shit
