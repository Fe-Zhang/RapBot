I found a place to sell my name
Along the markets promenade
High prices going down

I robbed a store to wear my shoes
It hurt my pride to bear these blues
High prices going down

Oh the rice is burning brown
And high prices going down

I woke up in my baby's arms
To the sound of fire alarms
High prices going down

I read the news
And I heard it said
There's 200 already dead
High prices going down

Oh the King gave up his crown
And high prices are going down

My mind's a buzz
A swarm of bees
And I did just as I please
High prices going down

There's no way out
The car's been crashed
And look around
The prices slashed
High prices going down

A dollars worth is half a pound
And high prices going down
