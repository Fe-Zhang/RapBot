I don't get tired, tired anymore
I just don't try, try like before
I can't remember, remember last time I cried
Don't feel alright, I think I wanna die

I haven't done the best I can
But I learned to be alone
And I learned to be a man
Now everything I see, I think I've seen before
I don't think I want to see a thing anymore

I wanna die, Oh lord I want to die
I said, I wanna die, I know I wanna die

It must be easy, easy to be free
But if it's easy it ain't shit to me
Don't want to go out, go out on Friday night
Don't want no money, oh no, I don't want no fight

When I go out in my neighborhood
And I stand out on the corner where I always stood
I used to think my feet were rooted to the ground
To everyone and everything in my hometown

I want to die, oh lord I want to die, I said I wanna die, oh lord I want to die

You know, I'll tell you something
I used to tremble, I used to shake
I used to wonder what it was like
I used to dance and sing
I used to drink and fight
I used to sleep with almost every single night
I used to stand up in the face of my adversity
I used to think I had a woman that would care for me
I used to get up when some one put me down
I used to think I'd love to forget about this spiteful town
I used to be around on every holiday
I used to walk and talk but I would stop along the way
I said I used to walk and talk but I got locked along the way
I said I'm through with walk and talk because I realized that I got something else outside the line
I'd like to think that everything I've ever thought was right

Oh, lord I want to die (x3)
Oh, god I want to die, I said I want to die
Oh, lord I want to die (x2)
