If I gore veil in my mind I could turn to reality
I would leave you behind, put you far away from me
Through this veil I will find I could see my mortality
I could see it stare back at me I could see him point and laugh at me

I've been lost, all my life now I've found what's meant for me
On the edge of a knife is a calm simplicity
In the storm and the strife there's a moment's clarity
When the quivering fraility now has all but fled from me

Today i saw an apple in my head and there was blood on my hands
Well everything was fire engine red and all the good pigeons sang

Bap ba da ba
Bap ba da ba
Bap ba da ba

Just as our point of departure could this veil grow wings and fly
But the truth that I harbor has no veil to make you cry
What a shame there is no cure for a fear of things that die
For the need to tell a lie for a dryness in the eye

Today i saw an apple in my head and there was blood on my hands
Well everything was fire engine red and all the black guys they sang

Bap ba da ba
Bap ba da ba
Bap ba da ba

What am I for, what am I for if not to lie among the palms
What am I for, what am I for if not to sing another song
What am I for, what am I for if not to paint the walls with blood
What am I for, what am I for if not to bury in the mud
What am I for, what am I for if not to build a shelter here
What am I for, what am I for if not to pass another year
What am I for, what am I for if not to wander through the rye
What am I for, what am I for, what am I for, bap ba da ba
If not to die
Bap ba da ba [fade out]
