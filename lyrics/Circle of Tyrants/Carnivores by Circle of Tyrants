[Verse 1: Necro]
I'm living a mondo life
Packin' a tanto knife it's sharp like an anaconda's bite
You get stomped in a fight
I love mentioning weapons
Enter the ring, steppin' on your skull
We do demented things when reppin'
Satanic like a cleric, leavin' ya mom hysteric
Shank your face with a kitchen knife til' ya look like John Merrick
I'm full a gore, brutal like a pit bull's jaw
Belligerent like demons that pull you to the floor
It's Mordechai, back from the dead, crackin' ya head
Open with a pipe, gettin' hype, back-up what you said
I'm like a skeleton covered with rotted skin
I got a grin, shankin' you til' I murder you cause I gotta win
Packin' a metal barrel under my ghetto apparel
Pull out and blast you fast that's how I settle battles
I would've loved to stick up Jesus
"Give up the bible, choppin' ya clique up into pieces."

[Verse 2: ILL BILL]
There come a time when the throne will become a prison
Kill ya idols and shoot the television, goon is in Glenwood
The truth is I live for the Art of War
I'm a ground zero Brooklyn carnivore, my position signing off
Forefathers, given these 9s from another war
Future primitives stargate through another door
I'm a king, my harem equipped it with 100 whores
Crush our enemies, drink out of cups made of skulls
Obey laws like the vikings that came before
A natural like lightning I came forth from the storm
I've been a soldier before the time of creation's dawn
Ate from the Tree of Life and cut my tongue on the thorn
I fire pistols like dry nickels
Get the drop on you like suicide bombers on bicycles
Colder than icicles
Explode raw, we pro-war, coke snort, spun the fuck out
Sorta like Mike Tyson on Zoloft

[Verse 3: Goretex]
I'm the palm of Ramirez, my arms are bombs for gear-heads
Decapitated, collected and wrapped like deers' heads
Back with axes, diseased tongue I'm a tapeworm
Da zombie ritual killer drillin' ya face-first
I leave ya brain chilled, soakin' in absinthe
Light you up in flames, same scene, chokin' on matches
Impaled Nazarene, Cold Lake
Your corpse shriveled up like an old cake
Slumped over the table, mortuary fate
Arteries shake on a blade that glistens
Gore bids, morbid kids who never break traditions
Deface humanity, my serum is as ancient as Christians
My sanity's off-vision, smiling at every incision
You coughing up lungs, splattered with the matter in bugs
Bury you dead with ya head oozing off ravenous drugs
Magic in slugs, cadavers getting hammered with gloves Sanitation's here to bury actors in backs of the truck

[Verse 4: Mr Hyde]
The Lord of Illusion, swords cause contusions
Gore's what your choosing, blood soaked conclusions
Armies of darkness, ravage your carcass
Death nailing arches, damaging targets
Creep with the creatures beneath the fog
Make preachers lose their belief in God
Teeth in your chest as you reach for your weapons
Undead zombies eat your intestines
Run through the streets, a marathon of C.H.U.D
There's no escaping the amazon of blood
You're powerless to fight, devoured by the night
No guts left in sight, disemboweled by a knife
Locked in my dungeon for months at a time
Then chopped into bunches of chunks when you die
Exploit your corpse, but gotta be cautious
To be sure, of course, watch you rot till I'm nauseous
