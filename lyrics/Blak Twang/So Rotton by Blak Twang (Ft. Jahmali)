[Jahmali] (Blak Twang)
Rotton!
Rotton! (YO!)
Rotton!
Rotton!
Rotton! (Yo, London and Jamaica)
Rotton! (Yo yo!)

{*Chorus*}
Why is it, so rotton?
(Tony Rotton alongside man like Jahmali yo)
Why is it, so rotton?
(Original ghetto true boy for the peoples army yo yo)
Why is it, so rotton? (That's all we do)
My people don't ask Tony Rotton (Don't ask me)
How is it, so rotton? (Don't ask Jahmali)
My people have you forgotten?

[Blak Twang]
You don't need to be worried 'bout what my name is
Or if I'm famous
You should be concerned if your burnin' in Hades where fire blazes
Feel the fire burn up ya charts, burn up ya playlist
Fire for the haters and fire for the fakers
Pump up the volume wake the neighbours
Brethren raise it, all o' the youth outta the ghetto break the cages
It's been ages, since you 'eard my style
But you know my style is rotton and you know rotton can't spoil yo
Nuff artists switch tryna become rich
They ditch the sixth sense lyrics an' chat bare foolishness
It's a whole heap of nothing dropping from their bottom lips
I'm droppin' the programme like a microfish, check this
I'm still Thameslink, still live on the brink
Still bang like pots and pans in ya kitchen sink
Still don't snitch a whip, still rent, still carry a stink
And I'm still rotton so put it in print, yo yo

[Jahmali] (Blak Twang)
{*Chorus*}
So rotton, so rotton (That's right)
My people have you forgotten
That it is, so rotton? (You know what tho')
My people have you forgotten (wa blow)
Why is it, so rotton?
My people don't ask Tony Rotton (Uh huh)
How is it, so bitter?
{??? only the youths them in a ghetto gonna suffer ???}

[Blak Twang]
Before you ask why, am I gettin' high like my blood pressure
Try lookin' into my eyes and see the world through my retina
Or step out in my boots and see jus' how far it gets ya
In a low-budget area where the man, you feel inferior
Fear for your life from prejudice and stereotype
We're all alike, smoke, drink, cuss, fight, all day and night
Yeah right!
It's killers in the mist who share pipes and wear tights
There's healers in the mist who bear light and wear white
There's Jesus in the mist, there's demons in the mist
There's even them ruddy 'Gorillas In The Mist'
Why am I so milli, c'mon brethren don't be silly
Get all red hot and chilly, and then burnin' inner cities
Ya best might sta', mind 'ow you flash ya lighter
Mind the 'S' or one night snipers gon' dim out ya life, cha'!
How much longer will this madness last
Before the youth should realise, raise up, and start to blast!

[Jahmali] (Blak Twang)
{*Chorus*}
Why is it, so rotton
My people have you forgotten, (Yo yo)
That it is, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten (Jahmali)
Why is it, so rotton? (Tony Rotton...)
My people don't ask Tony Rotton (...And Jahmali)
Why is it, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten?

[Blak Twang]
It's gettin' diabolical, nuff of dem are comical
All they wanna do is chronicle, money jewels, and tight abdominals
They ain't sayin' nuttin' new, all they do is copy you
UH UH UH, brothers and sisters what's the World comin' to?
I'm public enemy number one, runnin' true
Chuck demons, vanity and bomb fire 'pon ya crew
JUS' who the ras' who wanna romp wit' the formidable?
Rottonostra, chart topper, proper untouchable
DEF, London, I represent for all of you
West, East, South, North and NW
The terrible terrorist 'ere to bring trouble to
Phoney MPs chichin' man and bum-ruppin' BOO
Bun them like barbeque, steam like green callao
SLEW them and fry them like fish and vegetable
Don't make me vexed wit' you
Don't mess with my vegetables
Don't mess with my seeds, my weeds or I'm deadin' you

[Jahmali]
{*Chorus*}
Why is it, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten
That it is, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten
Why is it, so rotton?
My people don't ask Tony Rotton
Why is it, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten?

So rotton, yeah
So rotton, yeah
So rotton
Tony, Tony, Tony Rotton
So help them Lord
Show them Lord
Help them Lord
Show them Lord
Help them Lord

{*Chorus*}
Why is it, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten
That it is, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten
Why is it, so rotton?
My people don't ask Tony Rotton
Why is it, so rotton?
My people have you forgotten?
