[Phase Fate]
Don't listen to me
Take your own word for it
Experience the world
Take the index yes and pull it out your head
Point that to the left fence
Dig yourself from the red
Yeah i know what you said
Thought this was the end
Ain't no use in pretendin'
Now i ain't gon' try to defend it
But fate's in your hands
It ain't the way that you planned it
But what's in a plan
But mistakes and let downs
Comin' up short and sit downs
You fall for it when they put the weight of the world
It's in your head to keep you sat at a desk
And happy with a slave's pay and some hours to rest
Come Monday you're thinkin' 'bout Saturday
Come Sunday you're thinkin' 'bout tomorrow again
Come birthdays, go to work days
Thinkin' 'bout 65 when its done
Now your life was a good run
But what have you done?
Raised kids to do the same that you choose
Follow idols and you follow the rules
Follow suits and you follow the skirts
All you found was a pile of dirt
But what's it worth?
Now consider this
Try livin' in the present
Now you can take that gift for granted, get it?
Just like your gramps said it
Ain't no past that'll weigh on my mind
Ain't no future, just a moment in time, its rhyme

[Chorus]
We're going to a new place now
Take me there with your words

[Off Topic]
Who got that shit?
We got that shit
Dance to the bio attack
Dressed in plastic
Breathe real heavy til my lung collapses
Smoke ten packs and recycle the box, kid
I'm past it
Desensitized disasters
Grew til I died from youth
Aging backwards
My mother's heartbeat is the drum track for madness
My womb's a booth
Soundproofed and foam padded
Take what you know be and count backwards
Trace the roots back to seed and find answers
Trace the seed back to tree and find out
Why you believe what you believe to be about
I speak to the Gods you think you know
I fought with the devils you're working for
They back down then they come back 'round for more
Sit motionless, focused, wage the war
Protect the mind
With acoustic symbol rhymes
Derived from a simpler time
Redefined
Outwardly calm
A body at rest
Control the controls
Then train for the test
And I'll meet you
Our people move as one
A new age of our history has begun
I can teach you
But you got a razor tongue
Let go
Let go and be free for once

[Chorus]
We're going to a new place now
Take me there with your words

[Off Topic]
I'm drifting, farther than you can count
Inwards, til I might not make it out
And if the silence weighs heavy on your mind
Then you're deaf to the noises inside
