[Intro: Long Axe (Buda Love)]
Okay God it's like this, y'knowhatmsayin'?
If we don't manifest our power to the fullest (to the fullest)
Man, you know what I'm saying?
Nothing will become of everything that we plan God
(Understand and understood God
See we goin' show them the strength in what we doing
And this for the babies) indeed
(That's why it's on the strength
Everything is on the strength)

[Verse 1: Long Axe]
Simultaneous anger to this life I'm no stranger
Galaxy mission to attack and attract black
Diplomats in the world called rapture
Death was a concept I didn't wanna capture
The laughter singing over mantras, thieves
Street colleagues slow up, their man got tow up
Their guts be throw up sipping on rum
We sing from the creed of a Beggaz last son
Cash fast fun, no life undone
Take what you need son
'Cause your daddy made more than one
And it was fun till reality formed; screaming
From a palace where the weather's warm
Yo you have to be the father and the lord of the sword
Used to hover overhead now it's cutting your vocal cord
No more speaking the lies to the weak
'Cause I'm about killing these guys with my feet
Today it's a stage maybe later it's a cosmic force
The general, I be rocking on the horse
On the strength of course don't let it be in vain
'Cause it's time for The Beggaz to reign, remain

[Verse 2: Dragonfly]
Envision my facility a death world trilogy (you see that shit)
Now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
Battles won and lost at the gates of Heaven's throne
The sky rains blood drowning the Earth with red mud
I be sitting on the edge of Mars counting stars
Finding me a place in space unchasable
No mortal can't fulfill such skill they incapable
Of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
Make the Sun and Moon both shine at one time
I orchestrate the guns that air for God's sake
Precipitate make rain, hail, snow and earthquake
Levitate the gravitational pull of Haley's comet
Shake the core of the Earth make it earl volcanic vomit
Ebonic with sonic rays that blaze the human flesh
Its flames extraterrestrial inside a weak professional
Feel the untestable force burning your course
Its invisible thoughts be the source of Begga sorcery
...Begga sorcery

[Hook x2: The Beggaz]
On the strength! - time is money and gain
On the strength! - math is one and the same
On the strength! - whining is something for pain
On the strength! - Beggaz forever remain

[Verse 3: Buda Love]
Buddah Hava who lives the ways by nature
Escaper on a galactic space caper
To the nexus, transportation a glass Lexus
Forever present is Wu Chi in the essence
Of life is immortal we travel through portal
That's phenomenon paragon through the octagon
My Chi gong is calm, expressed through Alvatron
Love, hell or right as the day destroys the night
Night divides the day, Beggaz are harmonious
In universal ways through escapades
We take what we need to survive and stay alive
Draw more sometimes as we break through the other side

[Verse 4: Sammy Bravo]
The Knoliton master law and order astrologics
Civilize the human family throughout the populous
Live forever like metabolics, everything I speak has a logic
Estimated all partsman of the chi king fistboxing
Described within the Begga doctrine, manual unfold
My mental protect my physical from elements of the globe
We communicate like space probe
Remainder of the square factor, author of the final chapter
Seven star grandmaster, pugilist John Trapper M.D
Golgo 13 Professional MC
I bomb squads like Hank Shocklee
Expose a fraud like hard copy
I load, click and shoot like paparazzi
With the never conclusive euro language abusive
Street persona, my thought is blacker than the prima donna
Far and beyond, inflicting who warfare like Saddam
Invade area like Genghis Khan
Forever we'll remain and the Beggaz will continue to go on...

[Hook: The Beggaz] (x2)
On the strength! - time is money and gain
On the strength! - math is one and the same
On the strength! - whining is something for pain
On the strength! - Beggaz forever remain
