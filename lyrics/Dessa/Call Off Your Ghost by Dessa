[Verse 1]
Last night, old friend, big wedding
And I knew you'd be there too
Look at us, all grown up
Collared shirts and high heel shoes
You crossed the room, just the decent thing to do
Make sure we've all been introduced
You brought your new friend
I brought mine shake hands
Pay courtesy its due
But it takes its toll
And it takes its hold

[Hook]
We've lived too long too close
So call off your ghost

[Verse 2]
Now you're asking can't we just be friends
But this bell in my chest still rings
And it's better to just pretend
That I can't see you waiting
Can't hear you call my name and
I know how much you hate it
But babe I've got to walk away
You once said if we were careful
That we could do this all our lives
Although one of us got clumsy
And both of us got wise
And now we're not so young
Seems our wishing well's gone dry

[Hook]
We've been living too long too close
And I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready, so call off your ghost

[Bridge]
I think she lives around here
I see her almost daily
All I can do to stop myself from saying something crazy
I don't think badly of her
I hope she makes you happy
It's just a lot to ask to watch your future walking past me
I know that jealousy's a perfect waste of time
But left to my devices
I've spent far too long wasting mine x2

[Hook]
We've been living too long too close
And I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready, so call off your ghost x2
