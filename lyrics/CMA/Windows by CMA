"And she walks, nothing's moving
Cause there's darkness in the corners
And the sound of shutting doors
You chase the sunlight slowly kicking down the door
And the window holds no sight"

[Hook]
"The sunlight slowly kicking down the door
And the window holds no sight"

[Verse One: The Grouch]:
I remember the rainy days
Mama would drop me off at school in a bucket
It was around the 3rd grade
Melting crayons on the furnace, playing heads up seven up
Boy I was learning and I felt great
I had an Incredible Hulk lunchbox
A Michael Jackson jacket, three-stripe socks
Right before the first pair of Jordans came out
Every year I had a Valentine, she would shoot my game out
To work that pain out I'd eat a gang of candy
Cherry clan, Zots, lots you understand me?
My teeth were rotten always at the dentist
My dad played the police, I was his music apprentice
He drove a Cutlass, a 7-deuce dropped
Didn't know what he had though, I'm tellin you pop
If I could take it back to 80-something
I'd let some sun in, but you made us toughen

[Hook] {x2}

[Verse Two: The Grouch]
Mom said tough love, dad drink the bottle up
Sixth grade and candy's not enough
Mom bought me a snare drum
I beat it but I didn't get it yet
When they split, I was prepared
In school I failed mathematics
Friends made sense still, couldn't get the girls but I had some status
I'm a dork, computer literate a little bit
Moved to the east of the 'O'
Now I can feel a little grit under my toes
None of my woes were too large
But through any bit of hardship, character grows
Hip Hop's staring me in the nose
This block's preparing me for what was chose
A rose out of concrete's real
I've seen it happen before
Trade in my speech for a meal
Traded in raindrops for sunrays
Turned in 'no ways' into 'some ways'

[Verse Three: Luckyiam.PSC]
Little Tommy lived on Victor
Next came little sister
I used to be an only child, now you see me jealous
I was one of the nappy headed, sports-playing fellas
Couldn't tell us nothin unless you was a coach
I had a roach, a few but my parents wasn't broke
But broken in the union so I guess I got some hopes
So I guess I had support from that double income
Mama went to school to be a nurse and bring funds
Into the household like pops did
While she was taking classes at El Camino College
While I was extra baggage
The extra mouth to manage in the Christmas gets the package
For a latchkey kid who never thought he'd make it happen
The 80's started crackin, my neighborhoods was blastin
So my folks moved us out of that zone to face the challenge of change
Without a damn, I doubt it'd be the same
But I'd probably stand the rain til the sun shined again

[Hook] {x2}

[Verse Four: Luckyiam.PSC]
So it's bye bye Inglewood, hello Mid-City hood
The colors done changed now, I really wanna spree how
Corduroy's, Fila's, & snakeskin belts
Got bellbottom girls in the Sergio Takini's
I went to John Purvis first, girly was a meanie
Cheated on me with a dude that used to go to UNI
My confidence was puny so I let this cutie do me
Ruined me, trust in females & such
I never really bounced back from that
So it's rough on, any relationship I've had since that day
Or any hesitation of why not to play
Or reasons this cold heart is desperate for rays
