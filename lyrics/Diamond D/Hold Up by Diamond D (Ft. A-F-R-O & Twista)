[Verse 1: A-F-R-O]
Hold Up
Fro in a particular mind, the flow ridiculous
So inconspicuous, I do it with the pride
And them foes pretendin' they whole division is cold but kill ’em but won't listen when I'm shooting with the rhyme
With the heaviest weapon and villain artillery stock
And I step in and settle the deal like a general with the metal
Either I’m ready to prove that even at my level that the fellow flow and skills are incredibly sharp
Hold Up
Meant to be the head, Don Corleone
Beat 'em dead, feed 'em lead speak the best audio flow
You don't know how to party well then you ought to go home
It gotta be a body the way that my cardio go
Given a diamond in rhymin' and livin' the life
The nigga that got a grip
Give me a minute to rock and then I'ma give it a little throttle quick
They not ready to believe that when I body the beat, the chopper, the beast
I gotta be the one that came to demolish it
Hold Up
Walkin' hot streets, niggas hate they moderate
I’m on top of my peak and niggas take it for mockery
Rock shop I speak and I slay these ladies
Pop lock to the beat like them 80s babies
I demonstrate it
I say I never hesitated when my shit dope
Regulated, elevated, sedated, I meditated, nigga that never separated
Nigga the problem and nobody get ’im, a nigga that knowin' the formula to spit quotes
Hold Up
Get my nigga to understand the runnin’ man
Niggas stunned and sayin', "Damn, where they spotted Fro?"
Niggas are upperhanded, doin' enough of damage
Runnin' with the Rugged Man and we on top of the globe
Hold Up
Call it nigga-ometry the way that I can lay it down and I get to spit it dumb illa
It’s a lyrical odyssey the way that I get to runnin' off the mouth like Mista Tung Twista

[Chorus: Dillon]
Nothin' but big bucks in my billfold
So you know I gotta keep a couple L's rolled
When the spot gets lit, step up to me for a hit
You can miss me with that, tell 'em hell no
Hold Up
Back up off you're too close my guy I'm stoned you be doing the most you not sly
I was trying to kick it, but if I keep sipping liquor I'ma turn this mutha fuckin rap show to a-
Hold Up
Big bucks in my billfold
So you know I gotta keep a couple L's rolled
When the spot gets lit, step up to me for a hit
You can miss me with that, tell 'em hell no
Hold Up
Back up off you're too close my guy I'm stoned you be doing the most you not sly
I was trying to kick it, but if I keep sipping liquor I'ma turn this mutha fuckin rap show to a-
Hold Up

[Verse 2: Twista]
Locomotion when I get up in the race
I was itchin' to get up in the place
So I can spit in your face
I was searching for a beat like Diamond D
I was downstairs diggin' in the crates
Hold Up
An immaculate nigga from the east coast
I'm from the Midwest just creepin', so let's just peep it
Twista on the beat by the producer for the video for Best Kept Secret
Hold up
Even make a lion fear when I am near pioneers
It's somethin' when I appear on a track with the veteran
It be somethin' like medicine and the shit be so potent it be givin' 'em diarrhea
Hold Up
Feel every bit of it comin' up outta you when I be poppin' it
Like a DJ, my vinyls'll be so intricate
You livin' the rhythm, when I'm spittin', the flow will be intimate
'Cause of how I rap, I be countin' my Benjamins
Hold Up
Make you feel the Fist of Fury if it's the jury I gotta face
My violence when I bust, I be rhymin' in my cuffs
When the prosecutor ask me why, "'Cause I was fuckin' with a diamond in the rough"
Hold up
Lyrical tool'll be the ruler when I do ya
I make you disappear like the Bermuda
Especially if I blew the Buddha
Because of how I do when I do ya
And if you talkin' shit, I go and get the Ruger
Hold Up
Never givin' empathy or sympathy
Energy when I be killin' my enemy
'Cause I never pretend to be
Somebody that be scared of war
When I make a metaphor out of a simile
Hold up
Check out the flow when I rap a little faster
Comin' hard and plus I'm gon' surf
It's what you get from a natural disaster and the hardest substance on Earth
Twista

[Chorus: Dillon]
Big bucks in my billfold
So you know I gotta keep a couple L's rolled
When the spot gets lit, step up to me for a hit
You can miss me with that, tell 'em hell no
Hold Up
Back up off you're too close my guy I'm stoned you be doing the most you not sly
I was trying to kick it, but if I keep sipping liquor I'ma turn this mutha fuckin rap show to a-
Hold Up
