[Intro: 10k.Caash]
Huh?
Go, brr, drr, drr
Ayy

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
When I open the pit, I geek up (Geek it up)
Swajjur kicks, no FILAs (Go)
Give her Tic Tacs, sit back, relax
Six7 on the beat (Bitch)
Yeah, I'm a rockstar, geek it up
Poppin' too hard like a Pop Tart (Yeah)
No Levi's, I rock G-Star
Hop in, skrrt, NASCAR (Go)

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
Bad bitch, geek it up (Yeah)
Too much swajjur on the bottom of my sneakers
Geek it up, geek it up, geek it up, dip
I stepped off the porch and broke my lip
Be Cool, Scooby-Doo
Ain't no mystery, Blue's Clues (What the fuck?)
OK, KO, ayy (Boom)
Let's be superheroes
Mixed it like the Mixels
She like takin' pixels (Woo)
Ben 10 the worst (Aw yeah)
Big swag, big cash, big bag (Let's go, let's go)
Ayy, yeah, go, huh (Bitch)
Bitch, go, ayy (Go)
Geeked up in my polo
Playin' with my yo-yo (Ayy)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & GUN40]
When I open the pit, I geek up (Geek it up)
Swajjur kicks, no FILAs (Go)
Give her Tic Tacs, sit back, relax
(Bitch)
Yeah, I'm a rockstar, geek it up
Poppin' too hard like a Pop Tart (Yeah)
No Levi's, I rock G-Star
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: GUN40 & 10k.Caash]
Speed Racer
Do the dash in a NASCAR (NASCAR)
Green blunts and they stuffed
Look like Reptar (Reptar)
Brand new shoes, check out my swajjur (Swag)
Brand new Gucci and the Louis, in designer (Designer)
Her head so crazy, fucked up, I'll line her (Bitch)
That pussy get stabbed, no Michael Myers (Yeah)
Geek it up, geek it up, break it up, break it up (Yeah)
Whip it up, whip it up, bitch, that's swajjur (Yeah)
Jump in that pussy, you know I'll crash it (Know I'll crash it)
Hit the Woah on that pussy, you know I smashed it (Yeah)
Moshpit, I'm goin' crazy (Mosh)
West Coast Cure, got me smokin' lazy
Damn, this gas too strong, whew
Might just die, I'm pushin' daisies (Ayy)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
When I open the pit, I geek up (Geek it up)
Swajjur kicks, no FILAs (Go)
Give her Tic Tacs, sit back, relax
(Bitch)
Yeah, I'm a rockstar, geek it up
Poppin' too hard like a Pop Tart (Yeah)
No Levi's, I rock G-Star
