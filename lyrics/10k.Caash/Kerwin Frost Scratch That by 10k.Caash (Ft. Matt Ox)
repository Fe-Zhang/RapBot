[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
I need my West Coast, goddamn, that's my lifesaver
Feelin' like Kerwin Frost scratchin' on the turntables
808 hittin' too hard, it's a headbanger (Boom, boom)
Welcome to the Game of Thrones, bitch, I'm a dragon slayer (Swag)
Kerwin Frost scratch that (VHS, playback)

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
Big boy, stay back (Huh), swag surf, wave cap (Ayy)
Parkin' sticker, handicap, swajjur bag, fanny pack
Candy girl, throw it back (Huh), H2O, water splash
AR in a shoulder strap (Woo), run up in your cul-de-sac
Hahaha (Too geeked)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
I need my West Coast, goddamn, that's my lifesaver (Ayy)
Feelin' like Kerwin Frost scratchin' on the turntables
808 hittin' too hard, it's a headbanger
Welcome to the Game of Thrones, bitch, I'm a dragon slayer (Swag)
Kerwin Frost scratch that (VHS, playback)

[Verse 2: 10k.Caash]
Pencil tattoo, ayy, these are swajjur shoes
Swaggin' through the hallway in my new Santa suit
Double C on my Louis, bitch, I'm Gucci (Huh?)
Oh my god (What?), frosty swajjur
Double C on my Louis, bitch, I'm Gucci (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Matt OX]
Lookin' at my belt, and it got on two Gs (Two Gs)
Worried 'bout the money, yeah, I'm worried 'bout the blue cheese (Blue cheese)
Lookin' at my whip, he can't see that my coupe green (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm rich like Kerwin Frost (Yeah), yeah, I'm richer than a boss (Yeah)
My VHS ain't gon' pause, yeah, I be drippin' with that sauce, yeah
And my lifestyle Waffle Frost, new designer, what's it cost? (Ayy)
This a headbanger and my neck a chain swanger (Yeah, okay)
My drip got flavors and I'm a rack maker (Ayy, a rack)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
I need my West Coast, goddamn, that's my lifesaver (Ayy)
Feelin' like Kerwin Frost scratchin' on the turntables
808 hittin' too hard, it's a headbanger
Welcome to the Game of Thrones, bitch, I'm a dragon slayer (Swag)
Kerwin Frost scratch that (VHS, playback)

[Outro: 10k.Caash]
Kerwin Frost scratch that (VHS, playback)
Packin' through the hallway in my new Santa suit
Double C on my Louis, bitch, I'm Gucci
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten
Hey!
