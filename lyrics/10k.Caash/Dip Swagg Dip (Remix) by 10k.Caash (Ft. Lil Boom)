[Intro: 10k.Caash]
Ay, let me hear that ho, Jeff
One, two, three four

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Lean, swag, dip swag, (aye), lean, swag, dip, (dip)
Smokin’ on these woods got me higher than a bitch, (high)
Three plus three, (ooh), that equals six, (damn)
Hoes say they love the way I dip, swag, dip, (dip)

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
Just copped a brick, watch me flip that quick, (flip)
Outfit blue like Lilo, Stitch, (blue)
Look up in the sky and it’s bluer than a bitch, (clouds)
Two twin Glocks, (ooh), called chopsticks, (pow)
Peekaboo, (ooh), I see you, (wow)
Hey, lil' momma, bring your fine ass here, (right now)
I’m tryna beat at her back and disappear
On my way out, man, my leg feel weird
I feel weird, ooh, I feel weird, (damn)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & Lil Boom]
Ooh, watch me dip, swag, lean, swag, dip, (dip)
Smokin’ on these woods got me higher than a bitch, (high)
Three plus three, (ooh), that equals six
Hoes say they love the way I dip, swag, dip, (aye, aye), (Lil Boom)

[Verse 2: Lil Boom]
Hoes say they love the way I dip, swag, dip, (dip)
She suckin’ dick for a Walmart fit, (huh, fit)
Got the pack at three and it disappeared at six, (huh, six)
Xvideos is my local residence, (yuh)
Bitch paid me like I was her pimp, (pimp)
I walked in the bank and left with a limp, (limp)
That bitch come first like I was her rent, (rent)
Got two Glock 40’s and I call them twins, (twins)
Your bitch at my house givin’ top with her mouth, (woah)
She gon’ give me throat then I gotta kick her out, (get out bitch)
Livin’ on a boat, like my name was Dylan Sprouse, (Suite Life)
I cannot fuck her cause her pussy smell like trout, aye, (yuh)
You do not know me, what the fuck you talkin’ ‘bout? Aye, (bitch)
Dip, swag, dip, then you know that I’m out, aye, yuh
My bitch fifty, aye, (aye, yuh)
Like Oprah Winfrey, aye, (like Oprah)
She suckin’ titties, aye, (yuh)
Babysit, like Vicky, aye, yuh (Lil Boom)
You know that the beat by Jeff, (Jeff)
You know I ain’t gotta say nothin’ else, (nah)
She on [?], get blessed, (yuh)
She blowin’ on my dick like a ref, (Lil Boom)

[Outro]
Ay, let me hear that ho, Jeff
