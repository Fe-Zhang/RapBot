[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Straight to the club (Club), stunna shades on me (They stunnin')
Rollin' off of X, and I'm too damn geeked (Geeked)
My body broke, it's weak (Ah), I'm swaggin' through the scene (Swag)
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Swag so ew, when hoes look, them hoes scream (Ah)
Straight to the club (Club), stunna shades on me (They stunnin')
Rollin' off of X, and I'm too damn geeked (Geeked, I'm rollin')
My body broke, it's weak (Ah), I'm swaggin' through the scene (Swag)
Swag so ew (Ew), when hoes look, them hoes scream (Ah)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
In her spleen, dick up in her spleen (Ay)
I just took ten, twenty K on a scene (Okay)
Might have to wrap the red Ferrari green bean (Skr)
I'm with 10K, that nigga geeked off the lean (Where he go?)
Break her hip (Hip), I'ma break her hip (Oh)
Nutted on her lip (Hoo), then I swag dip (Ay)
How'd you do it, hmm? I could show you now (Show â€˜em)
Hit the whoa (Whoa), had them bitches goin' wild (Okay)
Six whips (Whips), they all got the low miles (Skrr, skrr)
Drip, drip (Drip), bitch, let's take a trip (A trip)
Fendi bag, hmm, chopper got the grip (Fa-fa-fa)
These hoes tellin' all your business for a tip (That shit sad)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Straight to the club (Club), stunna shades on me (They stunnin')
Rollin' off of X, and I'm too damn geeked (Geeked)
My body broke, it's weak (Ah), I'm swaggin' through the scene (Swag)
Swag so ew, when hoes look, them hoes scream (Ah)
Straight to the club (Club), stunna shades on me (They stunnin')
Rollin' off of X, and I'm too damn geeked (Geeked, I'm rollin')
My body broke, it's weak (Ah), I'm swaggin' through the scene (Swag)
Swag so ew (Ew), when hoes look, them hoes scream (Ah)
