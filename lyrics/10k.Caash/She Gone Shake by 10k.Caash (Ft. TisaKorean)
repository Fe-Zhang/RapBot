Bitch got a big booty, she gon' shake that ass she gon' move it, she gon' shake (Ayyy)
She gon' shake, she gon' shake, she gon' (Dee-Mac turn me up)
Work (x8) (Dee-Mac turn me up)

[Verse 1]
Bitch got a big booty, she gon' shake that ass she gon' move it (Ayyy)
Make it rain make it rain, go ahead and get to it
Hands, shoulders, knees and toes, she gon' shake that ass on the floor, shake that- shake that ass on the floor

I got a full cup of (?), fuck them hoes, that's a cockblock
Like the light baby in the spot, both hands let me see the mop
