[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
The black person dies first but not in this movie (Kio, Kio)
I'm a pyscho, arr, got a mask like Jason
Chase it up, paper feel so amazin'
Can't stop, can't lose temptation
Stabbin' people, yes, sir, sensation
One, two, three, four, I'm about to kill somebody

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
Uh, I got a knife, uh, inside my sweatpants
I feel like a villian when I'm runnin' with the Rugrats
The hills have eyes, better watch your back
It's doomsday, bitch, I'm comin' right back
Uh, okay, let's kill, let's go
I'm a zombie, I just seen my mummy in the store
I'm geeked up, arr, workin' on the flow
I reverse my hands and put my arms on my nose
She reverse her O's and put her hands on her toes
Reverse, reverse, damn, I'm geeked for sure

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & Splurge]
The black person dies first but not in this movie
I'm a pyscho, arr, got a mask like Jason
Chase it up, paper feel so amazin'
Can't stop, can't lose temptation
Stabbin' people, yes, sir, sensation
One, two, three, four, I'm about to kill somebody (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Splurge]
I got a stick (Uh), like it's hockey (Hockey)
Hittin' white hoes like a high school jock (Uh-huh)
Took his shit, but in college, gun found in his locker
Can't a nigga rob me, you got hit for your time
Too lit, put me out, bitch, you need a firefighter
I'm with your bitch, grab her stomach like Micheal Myers
Got a bad bitch and she evil like Annabelle
Might not go to Heaven, lil' nigga, we runnin' hell
We make 'em jump, duck in this bitch, Cade Cunningham (Ha)
Nigga play with 10K, get his ass cut in half (Bah)
Bossed up, nigga, 'til the ho Toronto bad
I'm tryna knock off his face, I don't want a mask
If I stand on my money I'm tall like Slenderman
Get your ass beat like I'm in the stu' with Timbaland
Can tell a nigga's presence like I'm readin' through your Christmas plan
Pockets fat like bricks, you get hit with a hundred bands

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
The black person dies first but not in this movie (Kio, Kio)
I'm a pyscho, arr, got a mask like Jason
Chase it up, paper feel so amazin'
Can't stop, can't lose temptation
Stabbin' people, yes, sir, sensation
One, two, three, four, I'm about to kill some—
