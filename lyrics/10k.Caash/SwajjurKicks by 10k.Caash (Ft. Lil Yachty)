[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Lean with my Brisk (Lean), curve hard when I sip (Lean, lean)
Ayy, this that swajjur shit (Ayy, swajjur, swajjur), I lean hard when I sip
No, them my swajjur kicks (No), ain't that 'bout a bitch

I got two for five, Applebee's, in the hood (Nyoom)
She gon' let me smash 'cause she love rapper wood (Smash)
Pump then I dump (Beep), blicks in the trunk
White cheddar cheese, swiss, it's in between
Yes, I like my money green (Ayy), smokin' OG trees (Swajjur)
Chillin' high overseas in my polo black tee (Geek it up, geek it up, geek it up)
Chillin' with Yachty (Swajjur), I'm too geeked (Swajjur, swajjur)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Lean with my Brisk (Lean), curve hard when I sip (Lean, lean)
Ayy, this that swajjur shit (Ayy, swajjur, swajjur), I lean hard when I sip
No, them my swajjur kicks (No), ain't that 'bout a bitch

Nut all on her tongue, ask that baby how it taste, ooh, huh (Ayy)
Ain't no face, ain't no case, hit the jakes
Ayy, pass me a lighter (Swag), what it do's a pyre (Swag, swag)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Lean with my Brisk (Lean), curve hard when I sip (Lean, lean)
Ayy, this that swajjur shit (Ayy, swajjur, swajjur), I lean hard when I sip
No, them my swajjur kicks (No), ain't that 'bout a bitch
