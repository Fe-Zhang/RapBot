[Chorus: 10k.Caash & 10k.Caash & Chance the Rapper]
Just me and my friends on this side (Ayy)
Just me and my friends on this side (Ayy)
Just me and my friends on this side (Ayy)
Just me and my friends on this side

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
Just me and my best friend, walkin' down, smokin'
Been through a lot of things, but I'm still focused
Baby, I feel your emotion, let's get it rollin'
Sexual commotion, rockin' and rollin'

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & 10k.Caash & Chance the Rapper]
Just me and my friends on this side (This side)
Just me and my friends on this side (This side)
Just me and my friends on this side (This side)
Just me and my friends on this side (This side)

[Post-Chorus: 10k.Caash & Chance the Rapper]
Go best friend (Go), go best friend (Go, go best friend)
Go best friend (Go), go best friend (Go)
Go best friend (Go), go best friend (Go)
Go best friend (Go, yeah, yeah), go best friend (Go, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: 10k.Caash]
Shoutout to you, 'cause you my best friend
And we gon' ball, stand tall 'till the very end
No switch up, but shit stay relevant
No change up, this bun unseparate (Bitch)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & 10k.Caash & Chance the Rapper]
Just me and my friends on this side
Just me and my friends on this side

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Me and my friends on this side (Yup)
You know my baby momma crazy like the East side
Keep it cool like the pillow, got a B-side
She could play for the league, if you reach, she'a teach
Freaks of the week, teeth like a leech
Birds in the build', with they beaks on my peeps
Always wanna stand next to me, wanna link
I just came to dance with my friends, get some drinks
They just wanna lap dance, I just wanna tap dance
I just wanna tap, tap, tap, Michael Jackson
Birds in the build', takin' pics with my best friends
Tell my baby momma turn that ho to a Smack Jam

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & 10k.Caash & Chance the Rapper]
Just me and my friends on this side (Ayy)
Just me and my friends on this side (Ayy)
Just me and my friends on this side (Ayy)
Just me and my friends on this side
