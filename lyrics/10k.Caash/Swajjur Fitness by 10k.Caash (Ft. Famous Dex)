[Intro]
Woah, Kenny

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & Famous Dex]
Sprite bottle misty (Mmh), lean man crispy (Leanin')
Chillin’ with Dex (Hah), in the Lamb truck lifted (Ayy)
Sprite bottle misty (What?), swajjur fitness (Woah)
Low eyes, too high (Ah-Dexter), damn, I'm lifted (Ah-yeah)

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
Bad bitch, get hit (Ah-what?), pop a pill, get lit (Ah-woah)
In this bitch, me and 10k, yeah, lifted (What?)
Oh my God, this bitch just got dismissed (Ah-what)
And I popped her like a Sprite Mystic (Pop a lil', woah)
Oh my God, oh my God, I’m so fly (Oh my God)
Oh my God, oh my God (What?), I be so high (Ah-what)
Hit the woo, then I drive by, ooh, and I catch an opp (Skrrt)
Oh my God, drive by (Drive by)
Yes, my name is Dexter (Ooh, huh, ooh, Dexter, huh)
And I do whatever (Ooh, huh, ooh, huh, ooh, whatever)
Your bitch, she suck me 'til I tell her (Uh, huh, ooh, yeah, get up)
Baby, get up and get jealous (Huh, huh, why you so jealous? Huh)
I don't care though (Huh, yeah)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Sprite bottle misty (Mmh), lean man crispy (Leanin')
Chillin' with Dex (Hah), in the Lamb truck lifted (Ayy)
Sprite bottle misty (What?), swajjur fitness
Low eyes, too high, damn, I'm lifted

[Verse 2: 10k.Caash]
10k, what's the subject? Math is the subject (What?)
Bitch, we gettin' money (Yes), easy does it
All you niggas are old heads, shot ’em with a musket (Bang, bang)
Run up, you get dusted, rank one does it
Bang, bang, candy cane (huh)
Stuntin’ through with stunner shades (Hey)
Two-three, LeBron James (Yes)
Dunkin' hard, hurricane (Yeah)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Sprite bottle misty (Mmh), lean man crispy (Leanin’)
Chillin' with Dex (Hah), in the Lamb truck lifted (Ayy)
Sprite bottle misty (What?), swajjur fitness
Low eyes, too high, damn, I'm lifted

[Outro: 10k.Caash]
