[Intro]
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Uh, oh, I'm a robot
Aloha, I rock, baby, rock, Pepsi soda
Stupid geeked, oh my, swajjur lifted too high
Ayy, I’m movin' like a robot

[Verse 1: G.U.N.]
If you ain't ’bout the swajjur, what you talkin' for?
She put her hands on her knees, then she touch them toes
Flows like a robot, know I'm slow, she drop down, she just go, go
I love her throat, my neck and wrist so froze, cold
I made it snow, we drive that Lambo
Just like we stole that ho, disappearing like a ghost
Poof, like, where'd he go?
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Uh, oh, I'm a robot
Aloha, I rock, baby rock, Pepsi soda
Stupid geeked, oh my, swajjur lifted too high
Ayy, I'm movin' like a robot

[Verse 2: 10k.Caash]
She like taking footballs, real nasty bitch
She kinky with this shit, she a real rock bitch
Check on my wrist, uh oh, glist'
Uh oh, bitch, this that swajjur shit
Two eyes, C4, whippin’ in that foreign car
No keys, push start, game over, restart
Uh oh, cheat codes, this swajjur, you can’t cheat, fool

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Uh, oh, I'm a robot
Aloha, I rock, baby, rock, Pepsi soda
Stupid geeked, oh my, swajjur lifted too high
Ayy, I’m movin' like a robot
