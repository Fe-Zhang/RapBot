[Intro]
(Kio, Kio)
Round one, fight!

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
I'm open up pills now I'm throwin' elbows
I'm standin' six foot tall and my fist in gold
Better watch your feet when I swag on the floor
I'ma get to the guap, my pockets can't fold (Yeah)
Uh-oh (My God), uh-oh (My God), uh-oh (My God)
That bitch go crazy, she— that ho (Uh-oh)
Move, bitch, get out the way
I step off stage and I'm 'bout to go cray
I'm open up pills now I'm throwin' elbows
I'm standin' six foot tall and my fist in gold
Better watch your feet when I swag on the floor
I'ma get to the guap, my pockets can't fold (Yeah)

[Bridge: Young Jordan]
Round two, fight!
Bitch, uh

[Verse: Young Jordan]
Whole lot of chickens, big bands like Clucky
Real thick bitch, Amiri jeans, they'd fuck you
Slimy ass nigga, young bitch can't trust you
Hit it first night, why you think I'd cuff you?
Uh, I got no cuff in my genes
No MK, my bitch CELINE
These not no [?], they Supreme
Shawty a sucker, can tell by her knees
I be [?] street, that's how they notice me
Prada my collar, lil' bitch, and it's chokin' me
Lambo' with speed, like, what you need?
Hi-Tech sip, this drink Codeine

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
I'm open up pills now I'm throwin' elbows (Let's go)
I'm standin' six foot tall and my fist in gold
Better watch your feet when I swag on the floor
I'ma get to the guap, my pockets can't fold (Yeah)
Uh-oh (My God), uh-oh (My God), uh-oh (My God)
That bitch go crazy, she— that ho (Uh-oh)
Move, bitch, get out the way
I step off stage and I'm 'bout to go cray
