[Intro: 10k.Caash]
Man, fuck Sony, fuck Xbox
Man, fuck everybody, man
You know what the fuck goin’ on, nigga
Big Switch player, nigga
Yeah, skrt, swajjur

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Nintendo, playin’ on my Switch (Ayy)
Picked up a bag (Huh), then head to the Cliff (Ayy, go)
Bricks move fast (Huh), so fast, too swift (Ayy, go)
Drip so swag (Huh), so swag, slimy shit (Ayy)

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
OJ, Vitamin C, what’s in your Kool-Aid?
Two Percs (Huh), geekin’ up on lean, too much swajjur, she yell, “Hooray”
She got a friend, Savage slay, water bricks in the plate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hooray, trap go boom on a bad day

[Verse 2: D Savage]
Xan, Percs, Molly, yeah (Ayy), she ridin’ that dick like a Harley (Okay)
I pull up with sticks in that Audi (Let’s go), fake ass diamonds, shit too cloudy (Rrra)
Runnin’ from 12, someone come find me, sippin’ on mud with a chopper right by me (Yeah)
I’m gettin’ money, give a fuck if you like me (Rrra), shoutout to Johnny Dang, bitch, I’m icy (Rrra, rrra, rrra)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Nintendo, playin’ on my Switch (Ayy)
Picked up a bag (Huh), then head to the Cliff (Ayy, go)
Bricks move fast (Huh), so fast, too swift (Ayy, go)
Drip so swag (Huh), so swag, slimy shit (Ayy)

[Verse 3: 10k.Caash]
Sonic Hedgehog, she slob on my knob (Ayy)
Shake it juicy for a check, too much swajjur, no stress (Ayy)
Water bottle on my wrist, water faucet on my wrist
[?], I checked your stats (Huh), damn, where them hoes at?
Just do it, Nike flex, swajjur kicks, run through checks
LIG, geek the best, I put swajjur on my bed (Skrt)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Nintendo, playin’ on my Switch (Ayy)
Picked up a bag (Huh), then head to the Cliff (Ayy, go)
Bricks move fast (Huh), so fast, too swift (Ayy, go)
Drip so swag (Huh), so swag, slimy shit (Ayy)
