[Chorus 2X: Sample from "Alone" by Heart]
'Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you

[Verse 1]
Back when I was young, I thought you were the one
In the long run, I realize that was dumb
Started acting out of character, you made me high strung
Questioning myself, which I had never done
Trapped in your clutches, only temporarily
Staying too much longer would have stunted me severely
An attractive young lady, no doubt I must say
Made it hard to keep distance when we went different ways
Just hearing your name, triggered an activation
That reminded me of our past infatuation
Your presence alone made my heart rate switch
Like records on broken needles that skip
Now I'm skippin' the games, plus cutting the crap
Never ever again will I get stuck in a trap
It's ironic, in a twisted way I'm thankful
By trying to push me down you actually helped me grow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
These days it seems you desire me more
For the same things I thought you first admired me for
Couldn't recognize then, you do right now
All of a sudden you're back, trying to stay close around
Acting as if nothing had happened
Pretending you had always felt my rappin'
But back then, you never asked me to rhyme
As I expressed myself you wouldn't give it the time
My passion was simply not acknowledged
The more I chilled with you, the more my flow became demolished
I can't believe that, it's hard to admit
The thought of maybe being whipped, makes me feel freakin' sick
I ain't no sucka, but I'll give you a lick
I'm excellent at foreplay and know plenty of tricks
Including all the fronts you constantly use
C'mon honey, find some new ones it's all old news

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know your steez, didn't take long to see
Soon as you fell for me, I instantly watched you leave
All your friends behind feeling neglected
That type of behavior, it's hard to respect it
Made you cry from happiness and tear out of pain
Left a permanent stain saying my name in your brain
That continually reminds you of the good and the bad
The chance you shouldn't of had, the man you couldn't quite grab
And it's never gonna happen, were not meant to be
Sacrificing for a selfish woman ain't my destiny
Your fake support's not deceiving me
I've got at least a dozen girls who truly believe in me
That's for real, I won't change the way I feel
Any energy invested, you'd probably try to steal
Don't want to deal with an old case of mine
Who's already proven to be a waste of time

[Chorus]
