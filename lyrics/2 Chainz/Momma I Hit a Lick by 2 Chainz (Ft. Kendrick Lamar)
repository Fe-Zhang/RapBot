[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I want it, I want it, I want it-it-it-it

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & 2 Chainz]
Chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly (Yeah, what?)
Wake up, Count Chilly (What?)
I'm up, Count Chilly (Up)
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Tell my mama I hit a lick (Lick)
Huh, mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I’m comin', baby, send the address
Progress, never digress (Never)
Your last one didn't pass the fly test (Test)
I eat rappers, no digest
Fuck a piece, I want the whole pie graph (Yeah)
Money taller than a giraffe (Tall)
Feng shui by the mic stand
Have you ever had two one-night stands? (Have you ever?)
I’m a emperor, very sinister
Somewhere smokin' on indica (Mmm)
Fox on me like Vivica (Mmm)
I pray for before meals, spiritual
Wack ace, bet a big face (Yeah)
They want my spot, they wanna switch place (Yeah)
They want the gas, wanna sip Ace (Yeah)
Baow, baow, straight to the face (Bow)
I'm takin' my lawyer the whole briefcase (Whole)
Makin' a play in the police face
They was like, "Man, he fresh"
I was like, "Go, DJ" (Go)
When they played your new shit
I was like, "No, DJ" (No)
You can go on and skip that
I buy a house and flip that

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & 2 Chainz]
Chilly, chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Count it)
Wake up, Count Chilly
I'm up, Count Chilly
Tell my mama I hit a lick (Hit it)
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Huh, mama, I hit a lick (Huh)
Mama, I hit a lick

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & 2 Chainz]
(Ahh)
Fall off in this bitch, I ball off in this bitch
My commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
I threw a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
And then I vámonos, applaud me in this bitch
C-notes, B-notes, P-notes all up in this bitch
Man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein (Protein)
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now flex (Now flex)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & 2 Chainz]
Chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly)
Wake up, Count Chilly
I'm up, Count Chilly
Tell my mama I hit a lick (Lick)
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
