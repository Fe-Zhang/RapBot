[Verse 1: Big Snap]
Haters on the ground say I ain't country enough
So I called Tubbs, bought some toys, started tearin' shit up
Ask Hicks about last night we was knee deep in that mud
It wasn't no special occasion, we was fucking it up
My boots was filled up with that Tennessee creek water
On a fast pace tryin' to get back to the Globetrotter
Forty shows and I'm bust, this year ain't done yet
I dismiss anybody that's tryin' to stop that
We ain't gotta film no video just film my life
And get the fucking cameras rollin' cause we might die tonight
Cause

[Chorus]
I'm a down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
Down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
Down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
Down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy

[Verse 2: Upchurch]
Way down south where the devil makes his whiskey cut
Where Charlie Daniels snatched that golden fiddle like he owned it son
Where country boys stay snappin' like some hungry alligators
Don't go playin' in my muddy water unless you wearin' waders
We're too country for rap, and we're too toxic to touch
And stay rollin' like fifty deep in them trucks deep in the cut
So when you hear exhaust clappin' off the road like a plug
Just know you in the land of loaded guns and big ass balls
Yeah we stay choppin' and gettin', smokin' and sippin' and floppin'
Cuttin' donuts in the field until the motor starts knockin'
I'm on my Craigslist shit bitch I'm backwoods rich
It's gonna take a fuckin' bullet to get under my skin

[Chorus]
I'm a down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
Down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
Down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
Down south, dirty dirty, crazy fucking white boy
Keep the cameras rollin' cause we might just die tonight boy
