[Verse 1]
Ain't no question 'bout, who the best
Macy gon' lay the track and Archie come to do the rest
Step in the way, multiple shots are goin through your chest
You must have called Pastor Troy cuz boy, you is blessed
And I'ma take him out the game y'all
It ain't no thang y'all
You wanna buck I'll rip you up like a chainsaw
The game's raw, boy, please believe it
Keep your bible with you cause you gonna be needin Jesus
Fiendin for chart-toppin hits
And Archie ain't gonna stop droppin shit
I'ma make a million dollars then stand on the top of it
Rockin it, until the day I die in this game
Archie with the Phat Boy addin the fire to the fame

[Verse 2]
A-T-L we bout that head bustin', we leave you dead cousin
Whassup, huh bitch nigga, you said somethin'
If you ready why you stumblin' to the floor, huh?
If you ready why you stutterin' "I ain't drunk"
I'ma show em why they call us dirty
There is no mercy for player, haters cause he ain't worthy
Heard of me then, "Hell naw" before, bet you done heard of me now
Atlanta, Georgia where the dirty be found
See I done did this since my younger days
Only 16 but my pocket's never underage
So let's get paid, cause I stay ready for it, please
And you is crazy if you think you ready for me, so who ready

[Verse 3]
You ain't ready for us, cause you ain't ready for me
Courtney B chop and knock a nigga down to his knees
Stay as crunk as can be
Who keeps it crunker than we
Nobody that's why we comin throwin bows and them knees
See our foes and they freeze
They be some suckas at heart
We ready for what you bringin so we bust ya apart
You bustas ain't hard, stack em up and knockin em down
Another cop in the ground, boy, who stoppin me now
Choppin em down, see how quick you drop to the ground
Playin to be raw with ya ball likes to knock you around
I done twisted up the game, there's a knot in it now
And if you didn't see it comin, Phat Boy lockin it down

[Hook]

We ready for y'all (what, what, what)
We ready (what, what, what)
