Intro:
[L]
Is this all you got?
One minute and you go pop?
You's a big disgrace
I aughta mush you all  in your face!
Telling me lies; you a real good lover
You a Two Minute Brother

Verse 1
[L]
I hate guys who talk a lot of shit
How they last long, and got good dicks
Talking shit: I'm the best lover
They all Two Minute Brothers
[Man]
No I know you can't be talking to me
'Cause I be swing long all night long
Know what I'm saying?
I'll turn your vagina stupid
[L]
See, I'm the kind of bitch that loves to be fucked
Trimmed, tucked, stuffed, and sucked
Up in my ass, deep down in my throat
So we can get busy, but jimmy wear a raincoat
He said
[Man]
Goddam that shit sounds dope!
Look no further, hoe, I'm the pope
Like religion, nasty or nice
You got to give me some pussy like a sacrifice
I got the full night, stretching after twelve
Like a burnt offering going straight to hell
'Cause I'm a pump you up, cold split your clit
Then let you cum in my mouth while you suck my dick
Then I'm a turn you over, belly up bitch
And lick that ass right where you shit
[L]
Well needless to say, I took him back to my house
Took a quick shower, rinsed out my mouth
My starving ass, my shit wet as hell
I had to do the right thing
[L & TM]
Take a Massengill!
[L]
We lay back coolin' drinking Hennessy
When he said
[ Man]
Keep it same to intervene
[L & TM]
Lift 'em up, spread 'em out
[L]
I'll have something on!
The beautiful was cold three inches long
Now I'm pissed and I'm ready to bitch
But my cunt's so horny, I don't give a shit
'Cause I'm one nasty ass bitch
And I need something up in my clit
I only got half of his, I'm still ticked
Aw, what the hell, just go for it
[Man]
(grunt for 10 seconds)
I'm through!
[L]
Is this all I get?
Is this supposed to be good dick?
Damn, you said you was a good lover!
But you a Two Minute Brother
Nigga, I ain't even bust a sweat
Not to mention, I ain't paying yet
I was about to be cool, but why did I bother
'Cause his shit shriveled up like a Vienna sausage
Now I'm hot, I got an attitude
It's time for dinner, I'm serving seafood
On your knees, motherfucker, let your tongue stroll!
Push upon that bitch until you hit my flow
And ladies, beware of those talkative brothers
Chances are, they're Two Minute motherfuckers
[Man]
Damn, maybe your shit broke!
I know you ain't been talking about me
'Cause man, shit, I was so far up in that ass
I was out your back
I don't know what you talking about baby
'Cause if my dick wasn't good, then why was you hollering?
Huh?
Why was you hollering?
[L]
I was hollering to keep from laughing in your face!
[Man]
Not all the time?

[L & TM]
Throw that girl, throw that girl, kick it
Throw that girl, just kick that shit
(4x)
Yeah, girl!

Verse 2
[L]
Most us girls do it and do it
And I'm the kind of girl that throws my back into it
Now here's the type of man that we can't stand
The one who always holds his thing in his hand
Talking about it all the time
Lying, and saying it's about size nine
Always got his hands between his legs
You know the kind, the one who always begs
The one who claims to be a real good lover
Usually, he's a Two Minute Brother

Chorus
(6x)

Outro:
[L]
B.W.P. In effect once again for all you females across America
For all those too short, two inch, all talk, no action
Two Minute Brothers
