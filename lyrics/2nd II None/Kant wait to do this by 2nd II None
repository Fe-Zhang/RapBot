We got the gin for tha hoes, and bud for tha niggas
Now don't trip if you can't handle liquor
We gotta get it on till tha break of day
Can't you make a spliff and that's the way we play

We got the, dope side, I betchu want to ride
Everybody drinking coz it's on tonight
The bitches in the hood, they look so good
They nicer to soft delivery[?]

If you wanna get to feelin' high
The homey big[?], check you break you off that Thai
But what about the cognac? Yes, sir, please...
Make sure you tell the niggas don't forget that I need [?]

Party's over here, fuck you over there
Now bring ya hoochie ass onn witchyo fake hair
Get it right, this part, [alif all your mind???]
Cuz some of you hoes gettin' dick tonight

Chillin' with my crew, with nothin' else to do
Lookin' for some hoes, to rip you right through
Ballin' with my strap off safety
I can't wait to do this baby

Chillin' with my crew, with nothin' else to do
Lookin' fo' some hoes, to rip you right through
Smokin' a blunt[?]
