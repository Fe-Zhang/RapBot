[KK]
I'll say what's up, KK's down for the rushin'
Niggas who are full of shit I think I should flush 'em
They from the other side, I know I couldn't trust 'em
So I cocked the gat... and said fuck 'em
Yo I'm my own man, a down strong man
I ain't fadin'? (shit..), you got it wrong man
What's up fool, we can toss or let's get 'em up
Toe to toe - so nigga, what's up?

[Gangsta D]
The Dee love the daily average ho
I was known to the bitches as havin' about four or more
A young nigga that was down for the title
The block gang was my rival
I remember bitches and bitches and niggas and niggas
And hoes and hoes, and all the good times at Centenial
And all the niggas that support the cut... y'all motherfuckers stay up...
