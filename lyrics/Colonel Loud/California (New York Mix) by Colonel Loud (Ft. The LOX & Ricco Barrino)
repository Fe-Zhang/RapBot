[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
First time in LA, I was out with Beyone
Second time, with some girls getting high
Then I hit the Dolo, then I'm slanging switches
New York forever, but I love them Cali bitches
I love that Cali weed, tryna get my medical card
So I can shop and blow non stop
Shout out to my homies that be showing me love
Every time I get around, they pick me up for the club
Then I gotta hit the hood, take me where them gangsta niggas be chillin'
Smokin loud and eatin' good

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 2: Styles P]
California, it's love from New York
Searching for that good blunt, blowin' the roof off
Movin' from LA, out to that Beverly
Had them longs out in the bay, plenty of memories
Only the green shit, never the Yayo
Hit a lick, then go spend a grip at Rodayo
Searching for moon rocks, I wanna get fucked up
Call Uncle Snoop, or maybe Daz and Kurupt up
Keepin it G still, know how to treat Phill
Fuck it, I wanna just chill with B Real
California, you know that I love you
Now let's mix it up, see what that juice and that mud do

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Goin' back to Cali, with something California
The women, the weather, and can't forget the Marijuana
Wrong hood, you get caught slippin', you a goner
I donate your organs to a doner
Step out the airport, smell the aroma
I swear to god, OG will put you in a coma
County, they got all the weed crops
Tryna find Dre, so I can get the detox
Meet with my agent, get some tv spots
When you in the jungle, check out how the Gs rock
Compton, Longbeach to the valley
Believe me, when I tell you, I love Cali

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali
