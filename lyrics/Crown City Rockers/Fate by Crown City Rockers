I seen sun in places that ain't never seen sun
Fantasies of you vision life to come My one, introduction to a real life
Energized so live facing world strife
Been waiting for you and ain't even know your name
Came at the best time sun clearing my rain
And it was best; I wasn't ready for the manifest
Completion, perfection every time we caress
Nothing less, cinnamon, mango lips
Her hips and mine fit and makes me trip
I realize the whole time I stumbled along
Every breath that she breathes is my favorite song
Word is bond body is a temple of light
Eyes inspire these words I write
And on moonlit nights you shine like pyramids
Reflect God's beauty, ancestors' wisdom
Gotta be forbidden that I feel this great
Most High all praise for fate, true indeed

CHORUS

Let me count the ways she got em in a daze
Happiness haze joy for days
I'm saggin thinking of you Walking for blocks
Diggin you like archaeologists and fossil rocks
Hip Hop orange juice and croquesacks
Got bangin body love and mind to match
I'm attached see the stats of the words I flip
For the longest time I tried not to trip
But damn you got a brotha feelin hella good
I wanna enter you aura and collapse
Build foundations cover the maps
I put that on the hand I write my raps
Make love on the bank of the Nile to New Edition
Inspired me to look into our ancestor's wisdom
Gotta be forbidden that I feel this great
Most High all praise to fate
CHORUS
