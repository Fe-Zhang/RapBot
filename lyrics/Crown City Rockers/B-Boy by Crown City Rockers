Beat street wild style yo mtv raps
Rap city 76 (cadi)lacs and soul claps
Abstract, kangols and baseball hats
R.T.D. l.p's and subway maps
Gang tats, kicking fresh freestyle raps
Hoodied up looking so what and being in packs
Star wars corner stores getting yours world tours
One arm hugs, new songs making you bug
Walkmans, that rapper you can't stand
Not being able to rhyme without using your hands
The running man soul jams 88 to 93
Rakim M.C. Lyte Stetsasonic Heavy D
Wack M.C's?, Fresh M.C.'s!
Windmills 90's pop lock rock freeze!
Stacking cheese, 40's and trees
T-shirts khackis, doing things the G way
Like Graffiti on the freeway
Altadena east bay, moving your neck
Where your hands in the air is a sign of respect
Street intellect derilect knowledge in the rhyme
Greeting with a pound nod
Throwing up a sign
The perfect set, when D.J.'s get wreck
The feeling when the music in the club make you sweat
Mix tapes acting like your hard when you ain't
Sound and smell of an aerosol can when you paint

CHORUS:
I love, being a B-Boy!

B-Boy pose while you rappin' along
Everybody in the club really feeling the song
It started in New York with some tables and mics
Now every country on the planet got somebody who write
And that's tight like fistfights
Really going thru it paying dues doing music
Tagging black books, hardcore looks
Circles so the dancers get busy
Culture felt and dealt from suburbs to inner cities
Ugly and pretty people get with me group photos
Slang rhyming to yourself just to maintain
With your booming system rocking fresh gear
Records in pairs B-Girls backpacks
Kinda limping when you walk cuz it's been like that
Riding the rails staring at walls by train tracks
Croquasacks saggin rocking with a live band
Ripping next level music with the mic in my hand
Where my friends is fam you hear the music groove to it
Being first generation hip-hop music
Culture pride rocking hats to the side plushed out rides
All beat diggers worldwide
Vibe to the drum loops, soul reggae and roots
Forming groups, idolizing scrap and scoop
Knowing the "B"in B-Boy stands for break
I'm still using the term yo it sound so great

CHORUS:
I love being a B-Boy!
