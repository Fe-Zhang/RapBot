"Try keeping it real but you should try keeping it right" - De La Soul 'Stakes Is High

[Verse One]
Find so many problems existing within our globe
How must you be so narrow minded rapping about money and clothes, silly hoes
I suppose I label you my bitch
You do whatever I say and and I'll buy you expensive shit
What's this? Worthless minds working together its silly
Gangsters on the corner acting drunk and getting jiggy
Really I got to say that I'm glad you exist
Cause if there wasn't there would be no one to make fun of and diss
With money cash and weed and fame
All as lame as Africans with Italian names
Change your strategy
I'll stand firm without four niggas backing me
Stack g's if you will
But if you got the skills and knowledge this is how we keep it real
