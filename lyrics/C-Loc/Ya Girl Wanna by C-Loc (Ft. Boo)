First Verse (C-Loc):

Too many Baby Girl, can't even count the days
You had my head fucked up with your conspicuous ways
In a day, made the average nigga pass out
Bendin' all over in front me, like you want me, with your ass out
It's a muthafucka, playin' with the wrong brotha
Could never touch it, cuz I know my dogg got love for ya
If he knew the game, shit'll change, I don't wanna see my dogg sick
Findin' out he's in love with a bitch
You know the nigga quick to kill somethin'
Ain't no frontin'
Got me in a real situation, bad as I want it
I need to tell my nigga, and fear that he'll hold a grudge
Niggas take shit fucked up when they in love
Be right back with the bitch, lookin' at you like he wanna empty clips
Make you grab your shit, sayin' "What the fuck is this?"
Startin' to get cool, with your partnas and they mate don't mix
Have you caught up in some serious bullshit

Chorus (C-Loc):

You know your girl wanna fuck your dogg, right?
Yeah nigga, your girl wanna fuck your dogg, nigga

(2x)

Second Verse (Boo):

Stop by to pay my boy a visit, I seen you scopin' from a distance
In the kitchen blowin' me kisses
Askin' for my digits
Tempted to fuck wit'cha and I'm tryin' to avoid it
But she's dancin' with her ass all on me at the party
Grabbin' dick, checkin' in at Motel 6
On some high/drunk shit, get my dick licked
By my partna's main bitch, see I know he gone trip
Because this the same bitch, that's carryin' his kid
Plus people she did, she let her friend know
And her friend let her man know
Now we havin' problems over scandolous assholes
Hope it don't result to the pistol
See how pussy turn situations crystal?
Now I done put scars upon your temple because you violated
And got me thinkin' "How the fuck I'ma face him?"
You know?

Chorus

Third Verse (C-Loc):

Okay today she heard this, yesterday she heard that
Now Boo, you say that's your girl, but she gone get her ass slapped
Wanna sit around and clown you bout how I'm no good
Sometimes she make me feel like, she want the wood
Around these messy ass hoes keep my shit confidential
What you expect?  Speakin' on my bedroom credentials
I done sexed from my room to the next day lie
Even told 'em how I paid off the Q-45
They want a piece of that
Even if they have to double back
Tryin' to cut your rope so they can pick up the slack
I'm takin' care of home, ain't no sense in goin' in no zone
Bout some dumb shit that your girls ran quick
These hoes doin' bad Baby, stake your claim
I tell you girls is sad, they plays a helluva game
Now I done told ya, you need to give this hoe a cold shoulder
Or let her know next time that she come over, cuz....

Chorus (4x)
