[Verse 1]
Yo I could rap like Jay, could rap like Ye
Could rap like Kiss, I can rap your bitch
Girls like, I usually don’t mess with big niggas see Dice
Be like yo wassup with this nigga is he taken?
Behind me, a trail of hearts breaken
Long as the dreads on a rascla jamaican
My freestyle receive, a standing ovation
Clearly surpassing Shakespeare’s sophistication
Ye, I fuck dice and get it right from seraphim
Penthouse ballable, indoor solarium
And think of all the corny that this guy can’t compare to him
With a man slick as my wrist, I fucking bury him
Yo, quiet ride on the roof top aiming
Bend down to your girl’s ear lobe gaming
If she let me hit it, then she start clinging
In the kitchen cooking, fishing grill, singing

[Hook]
To the illest, to the illest, illest, illest, to the illest, illest, illest
To the illest, to the, to the illest
To the illest, illest, illest, to the illest, illest, illest
To the illest, to the, to the

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, I think I’m Malcolm X, I think I’m Martin
House of cards can’t keep out the Spartans
All I see is dumb rappers, I keep outsmarting
The ghost of hip hop’s passed and I keep haunting
A spoiled brat whining on the mike like a toddler
That’s why I always gotta keep my knife sharpen
And point it at the jaw line of the rap game
Because I know one day it’s gonna be all mine
I swear to god man I’m sitting on a gold mine
When the last miles on me that’s when it’s go time
I feel like they have me locked inside a coal mine
But I can still see the motherfucking gold line
I’m looking for a smart girl with a fat butt
And some corny ass rappers I can gas up
And run directly into niggas like mad trucks
Cause nowadays, everything about rap sucks

[Hook]
To the illest, to the illest, illest, illest, to the illest, illest, illest
To the illest, to the, to the illest
To the illest, illest, illest, to the illest, illest, illest
To the illest, to the, to the

[Bridge]
Baby, mhm, I want you to know that you the illest, baby
And when I tell you the illest baby, I really mean it
I’d do anything for you baby

[Verse 3]
Rap Hitchcock, riding with my shit cocked
Jamming niggas like Naughty and Bridlock
In the cafe, having lunch with my lips locked
To a 6 foot model named Charisma
And she don’t mess with dudes that wear tube socks
She only mess with dudes that’s like 2PAC
Hey yo, I feel like it’s me against the world
But it’s just me riding with a couple girls
But anyways I like to say, I’m a crazy motherfucker from around the way
I’m the illest, hey yo I never been a floating
Lay with the lions and I swing with the monkeys
Hung on the corners, sold to a few junkies
On every block except 21 jump street
Blowing through town on a whim
And may blow up with a clown on a whim
Send them to god then bow my head sing of him
I joke a lot but there’s no smiling within

[Hook]
To the illest, to the illest, illest, illest, to the illest, illest, illest
To the illest, to the, to the illest
To the illest, illest, illest, to the illest, illest, illest
To the illest, to the, to the
