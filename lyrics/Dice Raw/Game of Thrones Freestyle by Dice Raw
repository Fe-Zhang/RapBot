[Verse: Dice Raw]
There’s no I in team
But there’s one in king
The Isis on top of the pharaohs ring
Warming my lap with the pharaoh’s cat
The song I sing is the pharaoh’s theme
A herald full of woman denounce my religion
Announce my decision
A pharaoh’s theme
Call me Caesar, call me Hannibal
Genghis Kahn and Alexander mean
The merciless is staffed when you protest
I ask myself is it worth all this
I lost myself and I haven’t fell
Feet still planted on solid ground
Look in the mirror and you see the crown
Look further down and you’ll see a frown
Look from the balcony, I can see the town
Call the guards, and I’ll make my rounds
No one moves when I walk
No one speaks when I talk
No opinions ever offered
Disagree and I send the archers
Rose gardens, raspberry arches
Another lands, another shores
Send the soldiers to explore
They return with treasure, I request for more
A letter came and it requested war
A complex request, but still I can’t ignore
Request nonetheless, still I must oblige
Burn every house, blanket the skies
Every male child’ll die
I turn my back and then I close my eyes
To what you may consider a vow
No memories once considered a smile
No memory of the former child that I used to be
Joy and pain, love and anger
These emotions have eluded me
No fears, no peers
No wants, no needs
No reason to pretend we ain’t friends
No need

[Hook: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Joy and pain
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Love and anger
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Joy and pain, love and anger
These emotions have eluded me
Joy and pain, love and anger
These emotions have eluded me
No reason to pretend we ain’t friends
No need

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records and then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
Joy and pain
I used to know
Somebody
Now you’re just somebody
That I used to know
Somebody
Love and anger
I used to know
Somebody
Now you’re just somebody that I used to know
Joy and pain, love and anger
I used to know
These emotions have eludedme
That I used to know
Joy and pain, love and anger
I used to know
These emotions have eluded me
Somebody
No need to pretend we ain’t friends
No need
