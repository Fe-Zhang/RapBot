[Chorus: Khalid & Buddy]
I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted up
I'm livin'
Livin' got me trippin' out
No feelings
Man those feelings got me flippin' out
I'm trippin' (Ayy, yeah)
I'm trippin' out

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Oh, you wanna roll with the big dawgs?
Smoke a little 'dro with the big dawgs? (Big dawgs)
Pass that indo
Take one shot then I evolve
Put the tab on your tongue let it dissolve
And you got something to share you can get involved
Listen to Grateful Dead and I'm tripping balls
Hop in that UFO and I lift off, yeah
Fuck yo' plug, fuck yo' drugs
I got my own nigga
Took a stem and a cap to the dome nigga
I ain't been this high since Coachella
New level, I can feel it
Psychedelic
Please do not fuck wit' my energy
Is you my friend or my enemy?
I could do this 'til infinity

[Chorus: Khalid & Buddy]
I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted up
I'm livin'
Livin' got me trippin' out
No feelings
Man those feeling got me flippin' out
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin' out
Boy, I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted up
I'm catching all the energy you're givin' out
Layin' on the ceiling, man, I feel like I could touch the clouds
I'm trippin' (Ayy, yeah)
I'm trippin' out

[Verse 2: Buddy]
I'm back at it again
I'm comin' down Melrose
Runnin' a checkup for cardio
Smoking Luigi eating at Mario's
Okay, now let's see how far we go
Off the shits when I'm in the studio
Trippin' on acid with Roofeeo
Minds turn into kaleidoscopes
I think I'm goin' delusional
Brain dead, mind gone, warp speed
Flyin' through time zones
Roll a blunt about a mile long
Can a young nigga get his shine on?
Pour the liquor on my tombstone
When I die, bet I get my halo
Cause I aim high, never aim low
Bout to take off like Quavo

[Chorus: Khalid]
I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted up
I'm livin'
Livin' got me trippin' out
No feelings
Man those feelings got me flippin' out
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin' out
I'm sippin'
Sippin' got me twisted, up
I'm catching all the energy your givin' out
Layin' on the ceiling, man, I feel like I could touch the clouds
I'm trippin'
I'm trippin' out

[Outro]
Please leave your message-
You supposed to answer the phone when a real one calls
You must be high off drugs if you missin' my calls
What's up with you?
Get yo' life together, nigga
Call me back
You trippin'!
