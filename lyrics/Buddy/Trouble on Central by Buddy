[Verse 1]
Just so good at being in trouble
Spending my days out in the ghetto
Mama say that I need to be careful
Going downtown on the Blue Line Metro
Car overheated and I can't afford a rental (Shit)
Broke down Chevrolet, sitting on Central
Turning on my headphones looking out the window
Lauryn Hill playing, it could be so simple
Damn, I just can't wait 'til I get on
What the hell is taking so long?

[Chorus]
I wish I had a girl by my side
Wish I had a brand new ride
I wish I had a light
I wish I had a private flight
I wish upon the stars sometimes
I wish I had it right
I wish I had the finer things
I wish I wasn't so Cobain
I wish I had you (Shit)
And I wish I wasn't stuck on Central

[Verse 2]
Just so good at being in trouble
Spending my days out in the ghetto
Papa say that I need to be careful
Heard a nigga just got popped at the Arco
Pros on the hoe stroll, junkies on narcos
Long Beach, Compton, Watts to South Central
Damn, I just can't wait 'til I get home (Shit)
That's when a cop had pulled me over

[Chorus]
I wish I had a girl by my side
Wish I had a brand new ride
I wish I had a light
I wish I had a private flight
I wish upon the stars sometimes
I wish I had it right
I wish I had the finer things
I wish I wasn't so Cobain
I wish I had you (Shit)
And I wish I wasn't stuck on Central

[Outro]
I wish I was in control
Really wish I wasn't stuck on Central
I still got so far to go, yeah
Won't be stuck here, not for long
Just hold on, hold on
Work late nights and early mornings
I'm on it, I'm on it
Trouble on Central with the homies
Oh no, oh no
Pretty soon we gon' take control
Just wait on it, wait on it
