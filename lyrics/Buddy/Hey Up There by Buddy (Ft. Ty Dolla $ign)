[Chorus: Buddy]
Hey up there, I'm on my way up
Tell the radio to play us
Blame it on the place I grew up
Hit that land mine then I blew up
I've been on my job too long
Damn right I know what I do wrong
Ain't no way that I'm gon' change up
Now everybody better pay up

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Elevator on my way up (On my way up)
Penthouse, bad bitch with her feet up (With her feet up, yeah)
Dolla need that new Bentley truck (New Bentley truck)
They just mad they wanna be us (Oh)
Pull out the window, foot on the gas (Gas)
Mixin' that Raf with the Kenzo, I sell 'em out fast
Slushy, my diamond they wet
Slushy, my diamond they wet
Always been one step ahead, I keep my foot on their neck, yeah
Ayy, with the gang-gang, bitch I'm with the gang-gang (Gang-gang)
And when I'm in my Rolls Royce I take up two lanes (Two lanes)
They be like, "Boy, that's how you feel?"
I be like, "Shit yeah"
Ayy, DJ turn this shit up yeah this that shit, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Buddy]
Hey up there, I'm on my way up
(Hey up there, I'm on my way up)
Tell the radio to play us

Hit that land mine then I blew up

Damn right I know what I do wrong

Ain't no way that I'm gon' change up
(Shit, I'ma be like this for good)
Now everybody better pay up

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Pay up, pay up
Tryna get rich, don't wanna be famous
With my day ones, 75 cents to catch that bus
Came up, came up, got my check and then I finesse
Say I got next
Got right now so I guess I'll just, kick my feet up (Feet up)
Smokin' all this weed, I need a re-up (Re-up)
Give it all to me, more money, money
Can't tell me nothing
We out here struggling
This why we hustling

[Bridge: Buddy]
Never heard it like this, don't lie
You ain't never heard it like this, don't lie
Never heard it like this, don't lie
We ain't have gifts at Christmas time
Now I'm gettin' mine
Niggas out here be switchin' sides
Stay down 'til I touch the sky, that's right

[Chorus: Buddy]
Hey up there, I'm on my way up
(Hey up there, I'm on my way up)
Tell the radio to play us

Hit that land mine then I blew up

Damn right I know what I do wrong
(Shit, sometimes I be fuckin' up)
Ain't no way that I'm gon' change up
(Shit, I'ma be like this for good)
Now everybody better pay up

[Outro: Kent Jamz]
Granny used to tell me, "Boy, don't look back"
That was '96, I was bumpin' Outkast
She was up in church like, "Hallelujah"
Now it's getting scary, Freddy Krueger
