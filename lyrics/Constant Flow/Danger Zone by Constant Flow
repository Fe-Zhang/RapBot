[Intro:]
The larger global capitalist world is beginning to disintegrate
The austerity measures are backfiring
The banks and big corporations are being exposed
For their weaponizing of greed losing sight of poor people
Especially the precious children of all colors and all nations
It can be in Greece or it could be in Portugal
It can be in Harlem it can be in Los Angeles
Or it can be in Puerto Rico
We're talking about a global system

[Verse 1:]
I just for see word ma cous had a stillborn
You know ma heart feels torn
If there's anything to do to bring that girl back i'll kill for em
But me and God we like Hemingway and Gilhorn
Diego and Frida, Itina baby cousin in the sky nah I can't reach her
She in paradise laying up in extravagant mansions
We on Earth looking hurt like Marylin Manson
My other cousin turn heroine addict [can't believe this shit]
Damn, she was a [?]
You see her pops was a fiend and he died on halloween
From the very same thing she inherited that shit
We used to laugh at the stereo blasting
Now i'm crying hysterical damn it where is your casket
Got no tombstone just a box and a few bones
Dead at 32 three kids one at group home

[Chorus:]
Danger Zone
When you feel you getting older and your heart grow colder
Getting closer to that danger zone
If you made it as a youth life is sacred you da truth
God bless you, you could hold yo own
Now to kill one is a terrible sin
Everyone tryna find a revolution within
But the mind of a child is where it begins

[Verse 2:]
Ma girl late and I ain't talking bout a cabbie's pass [?]
Dog small me poor me I never had a dad
I said abort it she ignored it she ain't having that
She miscarried put the corpse in a plastic bag
Showed it to me all fleshy like a chicken strip
Uncooked she gave a stunned look cause I ain't give a shit
I said fuck it take that Tampo and flush it
We don't have to discuss it seeing this happen
The buttons on ma ass so so what of your motherly born
Next time I make sure that the rubber stay on
See I don't hurt I don't feel
And the birth control pills damage the gall bladder
Damn it, it don't matter I got us some raw data
Wetter than freakonomics abortion kill the crime rate i'm just being honest
Now every night I can't sleep dreams being haunted by that very same seed
Could have been a [?] man it's

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
A crazy man went shooting in a school building
Killed 20 kids now who would execute children
In Palestine phosphorus materials falls from the sky vaporizing schools terrible
And what about bombs dropping from an aerial drone over a child's home
Not the same scenario ?
When it comes to others suffer we think nothing of it
When it comes to us suddenly it's a touchy subject
Look what happened to the Russians with the [?] gunner
Damn babies man what's the world becoming
Military industrial complex quota
Mass production of firearms consume our culture
American violence poor schools and gun soldiers
A country of gun owners and blood donors
The rich sit back sip their club sodas
Brown youth shoot each other down we getting fucked over

[Chorus]
