[Verse 1: CF]
The fans want to know who I am so fam' listen
I'ma stay hungry, I was born on Thanksgiving
Broke the hourglass from that Alcatraz prison
Momma's water burst, I emerged from San Quinton
Nine month bid, the kid already got a P.O
G-O-D peepin' me cause I'm his hijo
Heaven's gate open, here's ya folk hero
Winter season freezing, it was so below zero
God threw me in that cold war, no free throw
Cause I owe him my soul and the church needs dinero
Mom from the BX, Pops from Manhattan
Hoboken is where they met but JC is where it happened
Puerto Rican seed, can you read between the lines?
Look into my eyes and see all of mankind
Three Kings died, their souls now combined
Red, Black and White, I'm baby Jesus of this time
Fast forward now it's cray, I'm Jesus in his prime
Not 33, but 34 was crucified but I survived
My pops dipped quick, guess he couldn't take the pressure
Nigga disappeared, I think he working with ODESSA
Mom moved on and she rocked them college lectures
I dedicate this song to kids who killed their child molesters
If you with me say it with me now yeah yeah
If you against me say it to my semi yeah yeah
A young seed born alone see one parent was transparent 
Virtual adult, raised by my grandparents
Grandfather alcoholic, water was his cognac
Grandmother was two words away from a heart attack
Died of cardiac arrest, Hilda was my teacher
Always kept me on my toes, no ballerina
Said son you got to watch for them rabid beavers
Cause they'll eat your wood and they don't give a damn about a dreamer
She dropped jewels like friends are just dollars in your pocket
And watch for the cops, they're going to kill you you're a prophet
I didn't understand then, no cautionary fables
Realized when I saw her corpse on that mortuary table
My best friend died with that knife in his chest by his wife while he slept
So that knife in his chest is this mic I possess
My cousin died high with that needle in her arm
Now that needle in her arm is this eagle that I palm
Gunning, we in Vietnam thumping
When you seeing me perform, something even FEMA be alarmed - we're coming
My soldiers died, I close my eyes and rest in peace my homie Screw
Shot close range for a gold chain by a no name in open view
So many died close to dude, but my time is over due
Met up with my brother Tech
Lost a brother, found a brother
Showed sun nuff respect, told me it was destined
