[Chorus] 2x's
Anytime you come to New York City

Click, click
Even if I catch you in the ride, you robbed
All y'all niggas gonna die word born

[Ms. Cali]

[Talking]
Look y'all cats is assed.  Y'all niggas can't rhyme
How you gone settle on my click
You can't come to New York, no more.  We see you it's on
You can't come to Brooklyn
We'll rob you and send yo ass back in a box
You can't come to the Bronx
We'll stomp you the fuck out, muthafucka
Any one of the bubbles, y'all barred
You barred from the capital of the world, muthafucka
We catch you in Jersey, we gone gang up on you niggas
Take your cars and break your jaws

Y'all niggas is disconnected from here.  Holla back

And the rest of y'all non-rappin' ass niggas
We gone fuck over all y'all
Y'all ain't Cash Money, y'all crash dummies
That's my word, Wild Boyz, east and south connection
Rest of you muthafuckas stay out my muthfuckin' business
You heard me.  What, what up, Wild Boyz
