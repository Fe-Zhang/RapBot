[Verse 1: CJ Mac]
It's a mighty fine day so I pulls out the trey
Needs my shit cut so I call Dante
Trims the gotee and gets the hair cleaned
Hits the switch for a bitch then i sheen
Squeeze my nigga Mad and my cousin OGP
And hoodsta Poppa LQ cuz that's a nigga's crew so
Slide like we always do
Breaking laws down the 'Shaw like a hoodsta suppose to
C-sawin', we ballin'
Four pagers and a phone cuz we got some fleas callin'
We're lookin far from rich
So a loc spittin' nothin but game when I come up on a bitch
Now I remember when these hoes used to look at G's funny
Now they all up on low tryna be a g's honey
Now ain't this a bitch
We steady fuckin wit hoes and steady dippin' the strip

[Chorus]
(Come and take a ride) with the m.a.c
(Bumpin' hoodstaa shit) with mista m.a.d
(Slidin' down the shaw) with D and Poppa LQ
And when the west side ride nigga what you gon' do?

(Mad CJ Mac)
I'm gon' creep down florence on extra tilt
You fuck around and try to clown and get yo lexus pilt
Mad's beats is the fattest, gold d's on they tightest hittin' so many niggas up we catchin' arthritis
Bag full a dank and a strap tucked in the stash just in case i gotta snap
But it's kinda unlikely i trip, I'm under less pressure since we come up on the grip I'm hittin' switches in the black toy
4 gates in the trunk and a bag full of selenoids
I'm tryna make the tramp flip
We steady fuckin' wit hoes and like i said we dippin' the street

(Chorus)

(Come and take a ride) so you can see how a G shake fiends in a 63
(Slidin' down the shaw) now watch em' C-saw down the shaw tryna ditch the law
(Come and take a ride) come and feel the wind blow, the endo
(Slidin' down the shaw) front and back side to side in my ride and mothafuck the law

(Poppa LQ)

Now you can go to any ghetto and find some thugs but in california state we got these crips and bloods and that makes me wanna remenise to way back when, before eleven year olds got a hold of mac 10's
I'm talkin' bout the days we used to blaze
And bump to frankie beverly and maze and marvin gaye
Damn, these streets ain't what it used to be
We used to scwabble before all this but now they shoot ya g

(Chorus)

(Come and take a ride) with the m.a.c
(Bumpin' hoodsta shit) with mista m.a.d
(Slidin' down the shaw) with D and Poppa LQ
And when the west side ride nigga what you gon' do?

(Poppa LQ)

Well ima keep the roller coaster down the strip on three wheel motion as we let the booty drag in the classic rag while the hundred spokes spin, we dizzy off gin
The beat is past ten and our grills have grins
Plus we got the females on the cellular tel
And they tellin' me that it's on if we bring some drink and k-y jelly, housin' the scene, the usual routine, we got our self-esteem and we back up on things
They used to shake me like shake and bake before my tape dropped
And told me nigga please you work for rap-a-lot
But now I'm big grippin' and flippin' the script
So won't you buckle up your seatbelt and enjoy the trip

(Chorus)x2

(Come and take a ride) so you can see how a G shake fiends in a 63
(Slidin' down the shaw) now watch em' C-saw down the shaw tryna ditch the law
(Come and take a ride) come and feel the wind blow, the endo
(Slidin' down the shaw) front and back side to side in my ride and mothafuck the law
