(Intro: Mike Marshall with adlibs by Keak Da Sneak)

Oooooooh!
(In the name of Rame)
In the name of Raymond, (yeah)
He was a smooth talker
Street balla (In the name of Rame)
Oooh ghetto soldier
I can't get over, losin', Rame, Rame, Rame

(Verse 1: Keak Da Sneak)

Uh, the Town is shiftin' like a deer
And niggas who got fear of blast, if we near
I've seen big time ballas get took out the game
Of playa hater-izm, victim, but not my nigga Rame
Sharper than a Gillette
Specially fresh in a Vette
Always known to swang
They hate to see a young nigga havin' thangs
But couldn't stop, get it off faster than he could chop it
Told me one day, if we wasn't signed, then he would drop it
I peeped the realest, and was juiced
Had love, so I only bought bomb from ten-deuce
15 for a dub, in da doe
Cleanest box in the Town, bumpin' the "Next Nigga Ho"
A hater tried to kill my folks, now what they do that fo'?
It's all wrong
See all the love 'n hollerin' kept my playa potna strong
He loved that Krazy click
So I dedicate this song in the name of Rame
A true, blue, soldier in this skrilla-makin' D-game
Still ain't never been leaked
A potna infiltrated anotha potna that's major deep
Was on the creep
Pass me the blunt so I can hit it, 'cuz whoever did it
They gotta live or die wit it
In the name of Rame

(Chorus - Agerman with background vocals by Mike Marshall)

I remember back when I was dealin' crack
(in the name of Rame)
Even the roaches and the rats through the ceiling cracks
Knocks whistlin' his name through abandoned shacks
(in the name of Rame, yeah)
But I would be a fool to let it hold me back
In the name of Rame
I remember back when I was dealin' crack
(in the name of Rame)
Even the roaches and the rats through the ceiling cracks
Knocks whistlin' his name through abandoned shacks
(in the name of Rame, yeah)
But I would be a fool to let it hold me back
(Ooh, Rame, Rame, Rame)

(Verse 2: Bart)

It's too much sorrow in my city and it hurts
One love to Rame, movin' them thangs in the game like EA Sports
Takin' no losses or no shorts
But why chu came first? Struck by the ghetto curse
Another victim of quenchin' a playa hater's thirst
But at first, it was all lav
Breakin' up them stacks of cash
Livin' life slowly, tryin' to get rich fast was all I have
It's game-related, I seen it comin'
Watched niggas start hatin' him daily when he flipped that box in a Vette, bumpin'
Nobody seen it but it's all hood
I figure them bitches who did it consider it all good
But y'all would, wanna live life shade
Get strapped in the game and take my potna fo' his last days
Think you've got it made?
Nigga ain't no runnin' back
When I put this gun in yo' back
Detach 'em, attack 'em
To the point no picture can match 'em
Put the pistol holder up in the shoulder crystal clear
Slit him ear to ear
Down to the very compound and off this hemisphere
So fear me there
I hit 'em up hard where it hurts
Then put yo' dick in the dirt
The Flow-from-the-Matic-Nina work
But the bomb in the blunt can't keep me perked
I need a fifth of gin
Now bust a blunt again
My friend, every corner I bend
I'm thinkin' 'bout Rame to the very end
So now it's all in his name
A true, blue, soldier, in this skrilla-makin' D-game

(Chorus - Agerman with background vocals by Mike Marshall)

I remember back when I was dealin' crack
(in the name of Rame)
Even the roaches and the rats through the ceiling cracks
Knocks whistlin' his name through abandoned shacks
(in the name of Rame, yeah)
But I would be a fool to let it hold me back
(Ohh, Rame, yeah)
I remember back when I was dealin' crack
Even the roaches and the rats through the ceiling cracks
Knocks whistlin' his name through abandoned shacks
(It's a shame)
But I would be a fool to let it hold me back
(Ooh, Rame, Rame, Rame)


(Verse 3: Agerman)

I know he's tired of the pain, but he gotta keep hustlin'
Wit two daughters of his own and can't be left out strugglin'
Gotta raise a family, so he's pullin' 24's
Dope houses full of hoes, Hennessy, dank, money and clothes
Task kickin' in doors, through the backdo' they gon' be chasin'
Crooked cops tryin' to set him up for beatin' all them cases
And if he go to jail, next day he post bail
Then go back to the spot, to set back up shop to make that mail
Day by day livin', and nobody don't want no static
AP-9 in the attic, flashlight directin' traffic
Pullin' a G daily, watchin' out for these snitches
Suckas hatin' and wishin', holes in the clothes from hittin' fences
The real deal, peepin' how others doin' it just to chill
But he be on the block hustlin' tryin' to pay them bills
Flipped him a Vette and he was ridin' wit the "skirt-skirt"
Hittin' corners showin' them hatas what the turf is worth
Showin' love to his folks, he's tryin' to make a dolla
"Here's the blunt, let's get smoke" that's what I heard him holla
Even though me and Raymond didn't have the same mother
I always looked up to him as being my brother
In the name of him
