Sickkaaa lufffaa, Sickkaaa lufffaa
Sickkaaa lufffaa, 3xKrazy's gonna buck it

[Verse 1: Agerman]
Drinkin' on a 4-0 ounce of malt liquor, Lex coupe quicker
Five-O'n the back of my ride, think I'm hot, checkin' my plates and sticker
But if they don't ride paaast me
Lil voice in my head say hit the gas G, go fastly, through the back streets
Through the cuts 'n trusts of East Oakland
You see pimpin' and ho-in'
L-E-O got the dank smokin'
These pigs on the back of my Lex ain't knowin'
The way my style it just flexes flowin', I guess I came up Charlie
Cause they rolled past and I kept ridin' bumpin' Bob Marley
To the shop to get my top drop Pioneer stereo incredible knock
You could here me comin' all the way up the block
Cocaine like sittin' on thangs with shocks
With a Glock, man I be hittin' yo' block
Packin' heat like Rambo folds the channel
Strapped with a gat that's packed with ammo
Never pretendo, break down indo
Throw the 'bacco out the window
Flowamatically countin' c-notes
Automatically countin' people
Hit 'em up, get 'em all bumped or zig 'em up
Bust some shots, those that rig 'em up
Fill 'em up wid a hollow tip
Till they can't feel shit
Man I'm so sick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bart]
It could be so artificial, just like a pot of artichokes
Choke in yo' throat, before you get smoked by my Fo' Fo'
Hollow point yo' 0's and families but casualties
Began the murder show, was on
Had it been my four percenters I load one in
Provoking ya whole set with mess
So scandalous that yo' homies didn't do shit
Blow his candle, look could ya handle this
Nigga at one four five
Lyrical dip 'em in chemicals and bury ya minerals half alive
Energized by naked lies, they all spat between feuds
These niggas be payin' they dues
But some fake and be rollin' in crews
So I stack 'em and stick 'em in tubes
Like bullets in clips in my Lu-ger
Let the bodies be viewed
So their families can pick and choose
At the house with a strap and a bottle of booze
Intention to get my cash on
Extension yet still I'm blastin 'em with the 44 mag-a-num
Yo who was out there draggin' 'em?
I don't know, he was supposed to go
It's crazy mothafuckas in the "O"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Keak da Sneak]
Strapped, with a tech and a chop, to the nutty block to get a dub
Cause Furley Marcus and my nigga Del got love
For yo nigga named Sneak, cause I beez
Servin' off ridin' with ease, feelin' the breeze
25 for sacks of 3's, Hennessy and squeeze
Not thinking about 5-0 and freaks, cause I be G's
And don't like my dick to be teased, bitch on yo' knees
The F to the L-O type speakin' never said please
Slappin' 'em silly, and not a gentleman like Willie, sockin' a ho Buckin' at her nigga with my fully, the shit goes down, like a 7-4 in the "O"
Now u know that fat Fo' Fo' buckin' fast not slow
Caught one in the chest and hit the flo'
Disgrace, unload on yo' face, with the clenched fist, Hennessy sippin' gradually
And thinking about a casualty
That kill or die mentality in me and comin' naturally
Turn yo' day into a tragedy
Buck up and watch him drop with the gravity
Had to be a 3 time flow 9, brutalized mind
Naked in a shrine off a jug of Rhine
And can't even walk a straight line
Doin' the shit, pullin' licks on lit
Cause these 3 mothafuckas from the town, is comin' with that crazy shit

[Hook]
