[Keak Da Sneak:]

Bitch niggas get eliminated, disintegrated
By my muthafuckin' nickel-plated, faded
Family member so hated
I'm one of the deadliest muthafuckas to know
Strapped with my Ru-ger, like Kelly keepin' it on the down-low
Down fo' lickin' 'n stickin', door-kickin' 'n sickin'
Luffa lockin', Ruger-cockin', heated like when I'm spittin'
Good riddance, fuck repentance
Grew up a menace and I'm in this
Game, another lost his name from dealin' illegal business
Repentance, feelin' no sorrow about them suckas I wasted
Relentless, and if you scared you better be gone with no traces
Erases mugs off faces knocked outta boots with double-tied laces
Duckin' 'n dodgin', dodgin' 'n duckin', you're fucked 'n I'm "Missing" cases

[Agerman:]

I'm ready to light him, lit him up my 9 got him, beat him up
No need for the muthafuckin' ambulance, that boy ain't gettin' up
Call the coroner to pick him up
We puts the smash down, y'all niggas won't last
Y'all niggas gon' pass 'til I buck these hot ones in yo' ass
Make it look like a piston hit yo' ass
Get ready to die, niggas be ready to ride
Hoppin' on a mob means emptyin' clips
Hittin' yo' ass with some Oakland shit
Too late to dash muthafucka, mash
Cause the last thing he knew, is the gat went pop and the nigga didn't laugh

[Bart:]

Please don't be confused with
The size of a nine millimeter, bullet
Knee-deep in yo' spine
With nowhere to run, to hide
Cause words gets served when bullets sprayin', muthafucka die
Open the back of your brain for keep on thinkin' it's just a rhyme
I'm sick 'n disgustin' with a MAC bussin' through you 'n yo' cousin
Plus all them muthafuckas you lovin'
Who ya foolin'? You thought it would die but figured the pound splittin'
It's hectic when you're fuckin' with dem niggas

[Hook:]

Dem niggas
You know you gonna die when you're fuckin' wit
Dem niggas
A lotta bullets fly when you're fuckin' wit
Dem niggas
So-called boss-ballers get U-Haulers so it's really that you're fuckin' wit
Dem niggas

Dem niggas
You know you gonna die when you're fuckin' wit
Dem niggas
A lotta bullets fly when you're fuckin' wit
Dem niggas
So-called boss-ballers get U-Haulers so it's really that you're fuckin' wit
Dem niggas

[V-Dal:]

How the fuck the night done started? Got a call from 3 T-uh a Krayz
Said dem niggas on the other side kickin' up dust and they needed a MAC-elev'
Fa shee-uh, then get the wagon cause it's Posi driven
With the MAC 'n a lead ski mask in the back and that's how I'm livin'
On the edge of deceivin', different caliber leavin' no breathin'
If we leavin' leeway for reason, now I gotta get even like Steven
Step with my heater, through the cuts 'n the struts so no one can see us
{???????], nigga this westsi-uh for li-uh
And it's dem niggas, from the other side of the tracks nigga it's just like that
So call up the U-Haulers and boldest nigga and now it's time to strike back

[Agerman:]

A G bring in too this E, hittin yo' block in a 350
Gat in that ass with a T-E-C, wrong nigga ta fuck W-I-T
For the marks that wanna test me, get stole on
Line 'em all up like a nigga a punk for the fact you told on
Snitchin' to the cop you gotta get gone right through nutty again
In my cuddy again, give my cuddy a spin
See my buddies again sippin' on some gin
Gotta tell a friend about these marks that tryina lower me like an elevator
Imitator, rumor-creators, nothin' but a plan to infiltrate us
I'm ready to bust and watch yo' forehead split
To let you mark-ass niggas know you fuckin' wit

[Hook]

[Keak Da Sneak:]

Niggas thinkin' I'm a wise-guy, so fuck a drive-by
Face to face, got him in the eye, Keak didn't do it and that's no lie
Niggas wonderin' why I'm still walkin' the streets
Cause I be in the cut flashin' and not a muthafucka' peep
A damn thang, burners on my hand, clenched-fist I hit these niggas wit a bang
Change the barrel on my shit and didn't have to bury that thang

[Bart:]

Cause I bet my maggy, make way right through his baggies
Niggas don't play politely so sweep him beneath his Nikes
If ya clowned you lay, how long could you last
If the town you stayed was deep as surround with niggas don't play around
Let the hollow tips rip open get in ya
Cause you know it's really that you're fuckin' with dem niggas

[Hook]
