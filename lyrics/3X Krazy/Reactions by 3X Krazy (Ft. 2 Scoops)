[Intro]
Uh
Mobb shit
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Hop in the Broham
Cousin man we rollin' stolen
Stay focused, go get the calico quick, we fearin' no man
The program
You just a dead man walkin'
You all witnessed The Sickness, it's only of the chosen
He said often
That money would change a fake nigga
You can replace me and mace me
But can't erase me off the rictor (rictor)
Like hundred-percenter right through ya set
To settin' standards like Tony
Montana, look at the picture
Go figure
Mutha fuckas'll go just like the Lotto
Gustafos and Noreados
I oops along and follow
The not-knows
When the Glock goes through ya Polo's
In my dreams I was hated and was told to go solo

[Chorus]
My Reactions, like tuff actin' Tenactin wit the Mac-10
Makin' sure my money stack in fractions
Just follow my lead an watch me mack it
Only way out of the situation is the savage
My Reactions, like tuff actin' Tenactin wit the Mac-10
Makin' sure my money stack in fractions
Just follow my lead an watch me mack it
Only way out of the situation is the savage

[Verse 2: 2 Scoops]
When will they let 'em G thee
I feel the fresh air, but I dont feel free
An what I wouldn't give to live the way I thought life would be
Mobb music, my only key
Mass artilery, prayers from mama
Combined to grant the serpents soul to brace for drama
They experienced the hard times, it all made sense
Then came the secrets of a gracious bitch
My crooked ways won't straighten
I'll chop these dogs
Wit a hand full of hustlas, but I'm on my own
Reachin' for prime real-estate, on the banks of Rome
One day... all my worries they'll all be gone
Anger expressed with empty shells, introduced to livin' well
Real niggas out to prevail
My guarantee
Smokin' bomb from dusk til dawn, my simple wishes
Shreadin' through the darkness of seekin' my fuckin' riches
The wild west, 'cause it'll make it without a vest
Hard blows and hoes to test, your last request
Descendants of vengeance
The out-done, can't run from repentance
My story won't go untold
The rocky roads
Hurt peers to the dirt to uncover gold
Set up shop, you can't be stopped nigga start livin'
You ain't gon' soar with the eagles if you run with the pigeons
Uh!

[Chorus]
My Reactions, like tuff actin' Tenactin wit the Mac-10
Makin' sure my money stack in fractions
Just follow my lead an watch me mack it
Only way out of the situation is the savage
My Reactions, like tuff actin' Tenactin wit the Mac-10
Makin' sure my money stack in fractions
Just follow my lead an watch me mack it
Only way out of the situation is the savage

[Verse 3: Bart]
I'm disconnected
There's no exceptions, I shoulda' stayed in school
Playin' baseball up on the tube
Instead of bein' on the news
I see it all out my Donna Karans
Constantly drinkin' thinkin' "FUCK MARRIAGE!"
I love this life I live
Who gives a fuck if I die or live
My only thing in this world is my kid
My baby mama full a pressure
I see our love growin' lesser
That's why I'm crumblin' herb up on my dresser
Naked wit out my vest protector
Two in the morn kickin' ya door down
Its goin' to the floor next to your four-pound
Prepare the Greyhound
I'm in the hood with the homies
All black with no mask, Fuck they saw me!
We throwin' up that EASTSIDE! (EASTSIDE!) worldwide
An stay high
It's Murder and Kamakazie and I

[Verse 4: 2 Scoops]
Celebrate, I scorched you when it's crucial
Shame with bliss
Drop the Mustang in neutral, an swing that bitch
Got a piss test comin' up, smokin' kills
Chasin' [?] go get balance with the golden seal
These songs are hyms that can seal my wounds
Empty clips for my dead ones, the Outlawz too
Or til, my conscious cannot be content
Until I make the ends, so we can cover this months rent
Defining moments of my life
Defeated opponents too strong for my mic
Glimpse at the corner of pushers and pimps
Layin' dead for the luxuries of lobster and shrimp
See in the district, statistics with phony fathers
Enter the realm where the Kool-Aid is Holy Water
Look beyond the Valley-Jo, I got a job!
Call my mom and let her know, I'm in the Mobb!
(In the Mobb! In the Mobb!)
(Uh, uh, Check it out, check it out!)

[Chorus]
My Reactions, like tuff actin' Tenactin wit the Mac-10
Makin' sure my money stack in fractions
Just follow my lead an watch me mack it
Only way out of the situation is the savage
My Reactions, like tuff actin' Tenactin wit the Mac-10
Makin' sure my money stack in fractions
Just follow my lead an watch me mack it
Only way out of the situation is the savage
