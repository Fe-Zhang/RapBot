*(Swoop G)*

Right back at cha!
Uh, 3 Times!
Let these fools know they fuckin wit... MOBB LIFE!
You know, B.A., Mr. Kamakaze
Keak Da Sneak, Sneaky One
Agerman, my boy
3 Times

Verse 1 *(Agerman)*

First off all I got no time for these bustas that's smilin' all in my face
These niggas like bitches be fake
From head to toe laced up wit' hate
Nigga I'm a playa, ridin'
Cause fake niggas be scary liars, runnin' tired
Got me strapped up in the zone to open fire
You got killers, we got killers, let's play the game of cash
Too many softies tryin' to cope but now I'm up on yo' ass
See mama raised me to be a leader, so muthafucka follow me
When the funk go down we ridin' either that I get you or you get me
Fear no man but God, so if it's on, it's on
Cowards, can't come and getcha, but I'ma getcha later on
I'm all bout me and mine
Fuck the snitches, fuck the bitches
Keep a nine when we ride
Cause we on a mission for riches
Niggas feel us, laced up by realas, killas and dealas
Give a fuck about ya feelin's, cause nigga it's strictly business
Nigga what? Back up off me you softy
I'm a cold piece of work like Gaddafi
When you bitch niggas try to cross me

Chorus *(Keak Da Sneak)*

The Sickness is in me
The niggas with envy the enemy
The remedy, Mac Nine-O
Have tendencies, leavin' yo' mind fraught
In blindfold, and tied up in a trunk
This is 3... Times fo' ya mind ho
And they find foes in a cut up sleeve
The Sickness is in me
The niggas with envy the enemy
The remedy, a Mac Nine-O
Have tendencies, leavin' yo' mind fraught
In blindfold, and tied up in a trunk
This is 3... Times fo' ya mind ho
And they find foes in a cut up sleeve
And I struts through the East

Verse 2 *(Keak Da Sneak)*

K-R-A-Z-Y just fuckin' shit up every time
S2 Gold on some shine
(And I...) keeps my nine
You gettin' robbed nigga
I put that on the MOB nigga
So don't be slippin'
Hate being certain
And thought them youngstas wasn't trippin'
Do G's get to go?
Wear them rubbers, get to slay
And all you G impersonators you gotta pay
Get fucked wit an A-K
Bitchy bitch (bitch)
On the verge of ??, no longer rich
See you's a poodle
And when you see them niggas better up ya shit
And you's a jeweler?
Jew-els and all, Burbons and Harleys
Reported stolen, you cowards, so niggas is ridin' Charlie
Lavishly coordinated, this family tree
Paraphernalia 2 Tha M.O.B
Got it tatted on my stomach
3 Times! When I run it
And the 'luffed thoughts to get love
That's what I'm sizzilin' gettin' them bucks
And ain't no bitch gettin' a free fuck
It's A.O.B. for the Nine-say whaaa??!!
In the cut
Throw out my dezzle
Tryin' to get off the hizzle
To the next nigga grizzle
The flack and we dizzle
Talkin' bout polizzle
What fizzle?
You got a man
Pulled over, she shot a man
Two left, so I bounced in
Wanna hit the bomb?
Bitch hold ya breath

Chorus *(Keak Da Sneak)*

The Sickness is in me
The niggas with envy the enemy
The remedy, Mac Nine-O
Have tendencies, leavin' yo' mind fraught
In blindfold, and tied up in a trunk
This is 3... Times fo' ya mind ho
And they find foes in a cut up sleeve
The Sickness is in me
The niggas with envy the enemy
The remedy, a Mac Nine-O
Have tendencies, leavin' yo' mind fraught
In blindfold, and tied up in a trunk
This is 3... Times fo' ya mind ho
And they find foes in a cut up sleeve
And I struts through the East

Verse 3 *(Bart)*

Nigga what?
We come out the cuts and fuck shit up like straight mobstas
Niggas is dyin' to die but ready to ride like Facemob-stas
Boy, ya feelin this gangsta paradise?
Dealin' we shake the dice and watch you end it wit yo life
We sold a gang a buddah
Like my wife you just a cutie
You actin like them groupies
So you dyin' to tell a hoochie
Just a bootsy nigga
I hate niggas that's down to rake niggas wit bitches
You steadily stackin' yo' chips but bumpin yo' gums to all them bitches
Nigga I know you love to hate us
Boy you should wake up
Before we touch yo fuckin' face up like mascara make-up
We stackin' more chips than in casinos
Dippin' in Reno
Mad cause we pocketed all them C-Notes
Nigga craps or Cee-lo
You shoot yo shot and get forgotten
Cuz me and my peoples gon' hit yo' peoples and gets to mobbin'

Chorus *(Keak Da Sneak)*

The Sickness is in me

And they find foes in a cut up sleeve
And I struts through the East


*(Swoop G)*

Crawlin' on niggas, but then we steppin' now
