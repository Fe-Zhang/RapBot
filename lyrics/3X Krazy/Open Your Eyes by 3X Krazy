(Verse 1: Agerman)

Look how they mistreat us
I know they wish they could lock us down and beat us
They wanted me dead before birth when I was a fetus
Makin' racial joke but scared to say it in my facial folk
Cause they see danger, many years of that anger bein' broke
Now what them folks know about that
He's sellin' dope to have a birthday because his mama's on crack
He never had a job, because he never had a chance
They figured he wanted to rob just because he's the black man
They pulled my race shot out
Makin' movies showin' people that I'm the dope dealer and high school dropout
I call it strange, like I'm livin' in a shootin' range
Runnin' from them coppers to hittin' the fences to playin' the dope game
And plus that three strikes is pointed at me
For three violent crimes, struck out with three felonies
The president want me killed or locked up, but I ain't dead yet
I can't smoke weed, but he'll let me smoke a cigarette
Open yo' eyes!

(Chorus by uncredited female singer:)
If you open up your eyes
Look around and you will find
Life is a precious gift to use
Got to open up your eyes
You'll begin to realize
Life doesn't always go your way

(Verse 2: Bart)

They got me trapped like 'Pac, uhh, I picture my face before death
No CPR no homies helpin' me gain my strength
Just pumpin' blood losses, plus lookin' around for who seein'
My main objective was obsolete from gettin' away and keep breathin'
I'm like a cypher structure, so barely hangin' from threads
Suckin' for breath but I'm seein' death so I take one blow to the head
Historic Holocaust in the history books in our schools
Like a soldier, I'm holdin' my 9, nasty wit' 2 gun wounds
Knowin' I'm doomed, desperate, my clothing diluted in blood
Message, makin' my mind, do the Man Upstairs got a grudge?
But I know my time was tooken, hurt from the dirt I was doin'
Just picture the hurt from all the dirt that purgin' this mob influence
How could he do this? Killin' me dead thinkin' he was my folks
Now I know, to open my eyes and realize once mo'
Life has its consequences, although you believe in yo' pride
Who died? Was the morning sickness of her 9-year old cryin'
Open yo' eyes!

(Chorus by uncredited female singer:)
If you open up your eyes
Look around and you will find
Life is a precious gift to use
Got to open up your eyes
You'll begin to realize
Life doesn't always go your way

(Verse 3: Keak Da Sneak)

I look you eye to eye, when it comes stare, won't dare to blink
For the fact they call me Sneak Attack and I react on what I think
I can't afford the luxury, like a star, of a negative thought
When bustas lookin' mean-muggin' me quickly lick 'em like a 40 of malt
Halt, when last time I hit and shot this barkin', lookin' inside the barrel
Trigger finger itchin', flinchin' but sparkin', and it's pitch dark in
Cop some booze, armed and dangerous
For catchin' a nigga, he famous
Every busta on the street know what his name is
Sho' ain't my homie, pulled out a sack and planted it on me
I tried to beat the case and still got convicted, this shit is phony
The police on me, throughout my lifetime all I ever seen was negativity
It's how I work it, I bag it up, no diggity and hit the blitty
But if my eyes closed, realize those, thangs might be chance
I'd rather be dead broke than locked up after used to livin' fancy
So open yo' eyes

(Chorus by uncredited female singer:)
If you open up your eyes
Look around and you will find
Life is a precious gift to use
Got to open up your eyes
You'll begin to realize
Life doesn't always go your way
Stay focused and don't go astray
Say your prayers before you lay
