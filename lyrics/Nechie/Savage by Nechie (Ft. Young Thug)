I take this gold rope off my neck and then put it on your head (Put on your head)
I take this ho and turn her to a slut, but first she was fed (Yeah, slatt)
I put a brick on top a brick, I hit a lick right behind Ricks
I had the stick (Uh), I let it spit (Uh), leavin' 'em dead (Glatt)
Get like this, twenty bricks on my fist (Woo, woo)
Get like this, all my slime niggas rich (Yeah, slime)
I put this bitch in front of the street, hope she get hit (Hope she get hit)
I leave 'em squared away, I hope it get squared today (Squared today)
Get like this, give a million to my bitch (My bitch)
Get like this, fuck poppin' a bottle of Cris' (Like this)
