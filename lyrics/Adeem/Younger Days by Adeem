Jump in your time machine and come back with me to the younger days...

When I was young I used play on the old man's apple tree
When I was young I used to scream out Ollie Ollie auxen free
Too young to blame it on these mistakes
But I'm too old to have any excuse for the trouble that it makes
Generations apart from my old wrinkled eyes
Following the childish breadcrumbs that keep falling from the skies
It's the piece of mind that grows from this fine tuned machine
Accomplish self fulfillment with a unfamiliar scheme
My motivation to be an adult has decided to catapult
Me over the picket fence to land on my 2.5 kids
I used to play in the sandbox with the same little voices
And I would always remember to bring a spare vine
Because the chimes from the clock would signify recess and
Tell all the kids that it's snack time
I'm less than a cartoon away from being last in line
While kickball is my life juice boxes are my therapists
Those are the simple pleasures that used to get
And they now leave me here motionless
Cause I am walking to the mailbox to send my life away with a signature and I remember the jokes we used to tell each other (Woah-woah-woah! You're gonna kill her)
You almost crushed that praying mantis
That's a crime that's punishable by death
And that would put your name on the list
Well rumor is that Santa Claus compiles pages worth of information
But that fake fairy tale has nothing on the damage that I've done
I broke 4 windows, chased 5 girls, not to mention the cats I've taunted
And still this year I got every present that I wanted

Cause I believed in folklore and made wagers for peanut butter sandwiches
The blissful innocence that gave me attention when I had new bandages
The transition's identified as growing up but I lost interest
The responsibility that will kill all my first star wishes
The corner of my room had my initials with a dunce cap that's colored and shaped
And it goes perfectly with with my superhero cape
Now my cape is replaced with this button-down shirt and a mature smirk
That shows my soul to be nothing of worth

[X2]
Finger-painting and typing, my marvelous hands at work
The difference in creating for my cause or as someone else's clerk
There are no more kisses on the cheek or red faces from embarrassment
It's that long drawn out process from those words I sort of meant

Wanna give a crazy shout out to all the things I enjoyed back in my younger days... Thundercats, He-Man, jolly bracelets, Swatch watches, recess, naptime, alphabet people... All the things that made it such a wonderful, wonderful time being a young child... a million miles away from all the cubicles and buttoned down shirts and all the brainwashing
