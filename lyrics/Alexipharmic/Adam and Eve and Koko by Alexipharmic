Trapped in the Garden of Eden, converse with Adam and Eve and
Their mother 600 lbs., smiling down from a tree branch
And poppa's gone, yet he left behind the semen
That would fertilize debates to question what would we believe in
Sign language primitive, no auditory vernacular
Predating the pyramids, I recorded this spectacular
Dialogue now to unfold, incomprehensible to behold
I recorded the story that was soon to be told, they said

[Chorus] - 2X
We're bridgin the gap, to create an evolution
Theologians provide beliefs scientists are refutin
Place the puzzle back together - evoke a solution
Now we're bridgin the gap to understand what made you human

Adam turned to Eve to figure where to begin
And their mother started laughing, commenced the saga with a grin
"First things first," she signed, "and what you've go to understand
Is countless generations predated the creation of man
Kind - the offspring - steadily growing to perfection
Leaping over lost souls to maintain the connection"
"Now hold on, hold up, let me see if I got this right
Each advancement's made manifest by past's previous plight?
What about immaculate conception? Divine intervention?
God's manuscript designed it, split it into sections"
Stone faced, they looked dazed, gazed deeply with bewilderment
And asked me what I meant by "God's" self-designed manuscript
I described to them the Bible, Bhagavagitta and Koran
Questions asked, answers given, the night progressed into dawn
"I understand now," they signed, with intense jubilation
"Now simply connect the dots, we'll provide a new placement"

[Chorus] - 2X
We're bridgin the gap, to create an evolution
Theologians provide beliefs scientists are refutin
Place the puzzle back together - evoke a solution
Now we're bridgin the gap to understand what made you human

"It's beautiful, if you think what it takes to be alive
And how far creation's come and evolved as you described
Yet your science and religion seem to bicker from sides
Realize that the divide is one that you yourself designed"
"But wait a second," I proclaimed, "you seem to be missing the point
Each side is a polar opposite, mutually exclusive voice"
"It's a choice," Eve interjected, "in what you choose to believe
But there's never an absolute, there's always an in-between
God begat the first atom that preceded the reaction
Single cells reproduced, evolution was meant to happen
In that way, humanity, in fact all of creation's
A representation of God's image, God's reflection"
"In addition," Adam added, "we're all products of the sun
Sons and daughters, mothers, fathers, all objects are part of one
Since the universe begun, and every being is cosmic
You may think you've missed it all, but you really haven't lost it
