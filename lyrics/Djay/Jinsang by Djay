[Verse 1]
Tight in my fist, like a rugged amethyst
This rap from Mercury, so call me Chali 2na-fish
Ya new to this, let me introduce you to the best
The one who rock the rhythms with the cess inside the chest
They plottin' arrest, the cops spottin' as I'm coppin' the rest
They pop poppin', heart stoppin' no option is best
Who woulda guessed, this poetical test
Would have a motherfucker stressin' puffin' multiple cigarettes
But fuck that, there's bigger threats, I'm fightin' for mine
Shouldn't have to lose my life cause I like puffin' on dimes
But forget that for a moment I'm just livin' my life
And don't consider me rapper I'm a lyrical knight, now
I got these most def hunnies to blaze
And this OG Kush look quality, we caught in a haze
I'm startin' a phase I take apart every phrase
And instead of dollars now its pure attention I pay
Barely started the maze, but my directions are crossed
The fact you so concerned with cash, that's where I know that you lost
Where I know that you lost

Jinsang
We dont game the same slang
I'm trained to strain brain this thang a dang shame
