(feat. Mr. ColliPark)

[Verse 1:]
She go into tha club
She ready to do her dance
And when she bust a move
Them other Girls all stand and chant

She move dont stop yo hips
Junk little mama gon get that grip
Shhhh - dont give no lip
Or else I'm gon have to leave you on the next trip

Oh girl, you so fine
Shake shake for me one more time
Gyrate that big behind
She sexy as hell and I ain't lying

[Chorus:]
Move that thang girl, Shake that thing
Move that thang girl, Shake that thing
Move that thang girl, Shake that thing
Move that thang girl, Shake that thing

[Verse 2:]
She smokin, her clothes are damn they're soakin
Inecy patronin, some love is all she wanted

Girl shake it like a salt shaker make it vibrate
