[Chorus]
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone

[Verse 1]
Where's my phone, I gotta get this
The freak of the week and guarantee I won't miss
Shake that ass and hit that split
Roll them hips and stop real quick
Don't move 'til you hear that click
Hell yea thats it
And its a damn shame thats yo bitch
She like the picture song thats her shit
Put that camera on and lets turn the flash on and you got your click

[Verse 2]
Its me the birthday boi
And I got a real big birthday toy
Take her to the crib and make so birthday noise
I just wanna give her some birthday joy

[Chorus]
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
Shake somethin for the camera phone
Take a picture for the camera phone
