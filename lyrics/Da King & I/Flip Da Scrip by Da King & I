[Intro: Majesty]
Awww yeah, uh huh, coming straight from the ghetto
Kicking some newness, Da King & I settin it off
My man Face, Majesty, Izzy, you know what?
Ha ha, catch a vibe

[Verse 1: Izzy Ice]
How smooth can I get? As smooth as a jazz sax
What a class act, now you see why I'm Mr. All That
Pulling rhymes from the back of my dome
The texture of the lecture is then transformed into a poem
Your rhymes are so boring, I'm snoring
Leave me so sleepy Sonny Murdock wouldn't know it's morning
Here comes the negro, one out of the two amigos
That's making the music leaving you hooked by the kilo's
Talking loud and ain't saying nothin'
Your styles are more shitty than buttfuckin'
But I got styles for Anaheim
Ever more deans, when I was nine I was a rough teen
Working hard for my assets so go buy the cassette
And if you're Jamacian go get the cass-ette
Take it home and peep the hit
Word up, cause I flip the scrip, there it is

[Hook: Izzy Ice]
Yo, I flip the scrip, cause you flip the scrip
Don't you flip the scrip because, yo, I flip the scrip
Yo I flip the script cause you flip the scrip
Yes I flip the scrip, the scrip is flipped (Repeat 2x)

[Verse 2: Izzy Ice]
Ayo, I write rhymes on the norm
You gotta have the mental uniform to decipher the cuneiform
Cause I flip the script like no one
That's why I ain't surprised when I see rappers running like Jesse Owens
Running away from the habit cause they average
Me and Maj just gots more rap than Randy Savage
More traumatical or dramatical form or tragical
Highly irrational for my capital style
Be ruffing and cuffing you up for a while
Bust how, I'm stepping and busting your butt then I smile
Cause I'll, display at a rate of parlay, I'm suave
And child, I'll groove and I'll prove that I'm smooth like Parkay
Margarine or butter, I'm larger than your mother
I've slain your crew so now I'm fathering another
Now how's that for negative encouragement?
Nourishment is what I dish out, you can't miss out
On an adventure, or a storyline
I'm Fantastic like the Four when it's clobbering time
Peep the skills, those that try to get it are sweating cause it's hectic
When I flip the scrip like this

[Hook: Izzy Ice] 2x (with variations)

[Bridge: Majesty]
Bed-Stuy, flips the scrip, you know it
Flatbush, flips the scrip, you know it
Brownsville, flips the scrip, you know it
Bushwick, flip the scrip

[Verse 3: Izzy Ice]
Bust it
Yo, I flip the script like no one else
While others rhyming pretty like a ??? elf
And if your girl try to diss me, I wouldn't care
Because her nigga's on my dick like pubic hair
I come correct because I have to
Ayo my name ain't Johnny but I'd like to make some Cash too
I've been rhyming long enough for free without fee
So where is it, G, cause I flipped the script

[Hook: Izzy Ice] 2x (with variations)

[Outro: Majesty]
Yeah, you don't stop, keeping it on
We just flipped the scrip, my man Face, Izzy, Majesty
Signing out, you know we got it going on
Yo, fade me, peace
