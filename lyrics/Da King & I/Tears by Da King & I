[Intro]
A September morning
Life didn't seem the same way it should be
I was just mourning
Thinking of all the wrong that was done to me, check me

[Verse 1]
Sitting on my doorstep, thinking with my head down
Alone in my own world with no one left around
Then out of nowhere comes my partner Majesty, asking me
"Yo, Izz why you look like there's been a tragedy?"
Remember the girl from down the block that I was checkin' out?
I was on my way to her house, sippin' on a Guinness Stout
Looking jazzy like ya don't know, my jewels were dangling
You can see it on the steering wheel of my Volvo
I wanted to catch a flick and that's all
Sarafina, heard it was playing at Kings Plaza Mall
Had bad vibes before I got to her crib
But when I did, seen her talking to this light skinned kid
Check it out
It's something that I so despise
Faking moves on the mind of a fool
Brings tears to my eyes

[Hook]
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes

[Verse 2]
Hopped out the ride, slam the door, press the alarm, is it on?
It's time to drop the bomb, but remain calm
Should I bring it up or should I just wait?
For her to kick it, dig it
She was out to get it like Gidget, I figured
So then I asked "Who's the kid that left your pad?"
"Oh, he's a friend of mine, I met him at the study lab in school"
Sounds like the typical, mythical, mystical line
Used by slime, but you can't trick me, ho
Then she said she wouldn't let it happen again
He came to the crib to help her out, so she had to let him in
Sure ya right, he's coming in the day, but he's leaving at night, uh huh
Mama told me they'll be girls like these, I said please
I spent money like it grew on tree leaves
It's something that I so despise
Faking moves on the mind of a fool
Brings tears to my eyes

[Hook]
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes

[Verse 3]
Another twenty minutes passed, then the phone rang
I picked it up and said "Hello?"
And then her friend asked, "Who is this? James?"
Nah, this is Izzy and I don't recall having my name changed
And by the way who is this? Ya bear witness, get this
If you was here, I'd probably hit you with my Guinness (Stout)
Hung up the phone and got crazy, cause the woman I called my lady
Was playing a role like Patrick Swayze
I just left like a real man should
Didn't argue a bit, feeling real damn good
I heard a brother say it doesn't pay to be faithful
I learned my lesson that day, and I'm grateful
But I can't face my future or my past
It's hard keeping caution, at the same time watching my cash
Making sure that I don't spend an extra buck, she flipped the script
Mr. All That got fucked, knee deep
It's something that I so despise
Faking moves on a mind of a fool
Brings tears to my eyes...

[Hook]
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, can’t keep these tears from my eyes
