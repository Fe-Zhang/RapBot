[Intro]
'Ey
Uh-huh
It's your boy Fat Al
And this song right here?
You know what I'm sayin'
For all my hustlers that be coming down
If you comin' down
And you playin' this song right here?
Open 'em up!
Even if the police behind you
Your doors should be open
They should be swangin'
This how we do it in Cleveland
'Ey!

[Verse 1]
It's the Fat Al, and I'm from the slab
First hustler put 28's on the Jag
20's on the Lac, 24's on the Cuddy
Pull up in the brown car, look like a nutty buddy
Now I got some buddies, that love the cap
And they love the Fat Al, just because the brother rap
Yeah I stay strap but I ain't talkin' bout the guns
Look when I stop, how my rims just run

[Verse 2]
Hustlers comin' up, So hustlers comin' down
Look at the tall trucks, got surround sound
If you talkin' down, then you get a beat down
Stop Sprewell spinnin' and I'm cappin' on you clowns
I am a winner, you are beginner
Look how I stop (Oh!) Blind by my spinners
Look at me damn, for to make a killin' man
When I stop the 28 spinners look like a ceiling fan

[Chorus]
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
Here they hate me now
'Cause I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down

[Verse 3]
Pull up in the Sundae, these boys can't top it
Paint is vanilla while my seats is dark chocolate
When it comes to cappin', they just switch the topic
When it comes to this rappin', they know that I'm the hottest
Tryin' to make a profit, boy you better stop it
That's my hustle man, these boys can't knock it
[? 2:28-2:32]
[?, above] hit so hard that I thought I did a drop kick
Look at the top, you know I'm a shot
See me ridin' in the cuddy with the boy Bron
I said the Cuddy, don't forget rich P
'Cause he comin' down slidin' in the Grand Prix
Earn got the Monty C, and Mike got the 8 ball
Spell slab back, does that mean we got balls
Think I might hate on y'all, I think naw
Matter fact, when I stop, I get applause

[Chorus]
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
Here they hate me now
'Cause I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down

I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
Here they hate me now
'Cause I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down
I done came down
I done came down
I done, I done
I done done, I done done came down

[Bridge]
Players in Cali (They be comin' down)
Ballers in the D (They be comin' down)
Hustlers in New York (They be comin' down)
Pimps in the Sha (They be comin' down)
[? 4:00] in my A (They be comin' down)
Don't forget PA (They be comin' down)
Them ATL boys (They be comin' down)
Dirtys in St. Louis (They be comin' down)

[Outro]
It's the Fat Al
It's the Fat Al
It's the it's the it's, it's the Fat Al
It's the Fat Al
It's the Fat Al
It's the it's the it's, it's the Fat Al
It's the Fat Al
Yeah they know me now 'cause
It's the Fat Al
I told the whole crowd
It's the Fat Al
