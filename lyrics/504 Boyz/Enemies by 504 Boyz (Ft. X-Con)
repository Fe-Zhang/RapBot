Yall muthafuckas better keep yall eyes open(Ha)
You ain't gotta see ay muthafucka to get hit

I got some enemies

And if I gotta die taking some yall with me
They best to be prepared for this war
Cause I'm get cha

It's guarenteed to hit cha
Got a hole click of muthafuckas
Call them souljas

Get your pussy ass crowded

Knockin of enemies with them two 23es
Gotta get em for they cheese
Pass It to tha bg's

That's tha reason you bitch ass niggas gotta go
Enemies with no faces

Chorus
Enemies Enemies
Enemis with no faces (x4)

We loced up and we still on a mission
Ridein four deep
2000 Expedition
Got a hole click and we strapped
Case we get into some shit
Gotta keep them in there place
Niggas all in my face
Fuck All these hoes and these no nos
And ride on some 22es low pros
And some mo mo
Kickin in your front door
Lookin for them mo z's
Strapped with them 44es
A click full of bg's
Alot of yall niggas still believe it's a game
Sence I made a come up
That shit bout to change
Either yall can roll with tha click that I'm with
Or every time I see you
We get off in your shit
If you can't stand the heat
Get the fuck out from the stove
It's all about tha cheese
Got no time for these hoes
I mean if you really wanna see me act a fool
Well get into my shit
And watch me grab for the 2
On tha cool it's the rules
You Break 'em you die
You thought you was bad
They think you can ride
Goodbye
Ain't know sence of catchin other cases
Fuck with the perpetrators
Them enemies with no faces

Chorus
