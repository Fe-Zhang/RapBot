[Verse 1]
I suppose I should tell you
What this bitch is thinking
You'll find me in the studio
And not in the kitchen
I won't be bragging 'bout my cars
Or talking 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you
'Cause I've got a brain
If I told you 'bout my sex life
You'd call me a slut
When boys be talking 'bout their bitches
No one's making a fuss
There's a glass ceiling to break, uh huh
There's money to make
And now it's time to speed it up
'Cause I can't move at this pace

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

[Chorus]
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

[Verse 2]
If you're not a size 6
Then you're not good-looking
Well, you better be rich
Or be real good at cooking
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face
Or you'll end up on your own
Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
Have you thought about your butt; who's gonna tear it in two?
We've never had it so good, uh huh
We're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm
You've misunderstood

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

[Chorus]
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch  (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

[Post-Chorus]
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch (bitch)
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch

[Bridge]
Inequality promises
That it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice
'Cause it's not going away
Inequality promises
That it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice
'Cause it's not going away

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

[Chorus]
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here

It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here
(Bitch)
