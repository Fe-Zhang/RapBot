[Verse 1: Time]
Have you ever put yourself in another's shoe?
Millions in prison, mothers too
Like if you don't have healthcare drugs become it
And pills dig deep, rock bottom is a plummet

Addiction is more about environment
So before you judge be them and live it
Like a lot of homeless are actually employed
Affordable housing’s been destroyed

Teens get kicked out for being gay
Shelters reject them so where can they stay?
No suicide, save trans lives
If you’re judging gender move aside

The news will tell the truest lie
Read Morrison's the Bluest Eye
Land of the free but millions in prison
No slavery except, the 13th Amendment

People cross borders to survive
How would you do to keep your family alive?
No human’s illegal, provide asylum
Here’s some empathy, you should try it

Think about ableism and the words you use?
Do you speak poison with the words you choose?
Where you at? Can a wheelchair go?
Subtitle your videos

Vet came home with the war in his head
PTSD, sweating in bed
Panic attacks, mental health is real
We all ways to cope and deal

Pema Chödrön said it's best to start where people are
Reflect on what you have so dialogue can start
You can’t have an orchestra if you don't have a symphony
Everyone deserves a voice, develop and deploy empathy
