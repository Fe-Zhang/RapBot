Well listen everybody, my name is Craig G
More rhymes than your mind to the deep blue sea
My goal is to reside at the top of the heap
Although I might be young, MCs don't sleep
For me to stay at one place are you out of your mind?
For me to step up you're gonna have to decline
With the power of destruction that my rhymes emit
Once my rhymes get started you might as well quit
If you're aiming for me, MC's you'll miss
When I say a rhyme you can't resist
In the world of rap music I gave much clout
With the devastating rhymes that make you shout

Shout!
Shout!
Shout!

All the rhymes that I say are my own preposition
If you battle me you'll be using demolition
Using demolition that's what I say
You'll be making conjunctions right out of your hay
On the microphone I will dis your fate
Cause the rhymes that I say are my choice of taste
When I rock the mic I use my own proportion
On the microphone I'm an act of caution
When you run into me there won't be much distortion
And when you go against me it will be your own misfortune
When I rock the mic I turn things out
Cuz when I say a rhyme you wanna shout

Shout!
Shout!

I rock on the mic with all the clout
Now I'm gonna tell ya bout the things I can do without
I could do without the girls who walk by
When I make a gesture or say hi
I could do without those girls who sleazy
And the girls I get too easy
I could do without those weak MCs
Bitin' rhyme after rhyme such as these
I could do without rappers who think they're good
Sayin' that they're better every way they could
Talkin' bout how they're greater without
But I'm gonna make you MCs shout

Shout!
Shout!
Shout!

I rock the mic better than doin'
When I say a rhyme MCs get ruined
When I say a rhyme I put ya on the spot
So listen to me as I do the beatbox
