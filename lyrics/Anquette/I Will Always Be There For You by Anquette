[Verse 1]
I never met a person quite like you
Someone that makes me feel loved
I wanna be the one that you are thinking of
The one that brightens your day

[Pre-Chorus]
Because there's nobody else
That can do the things you do forever
I'll be there for you
So when you feel the need to love
Let me be the one you're thinking of
Because I will make it so right

[Chorus]
Forever and ever
I will always be there for you
Forever and ever
I will always be there for you
Baby I promise

[Verse 2]
I've got to tell you
What I feel in my heart
I wrote this song just to say
No one's ever gonna love me
Nobody but you
I'm yours from this very day

[Pre-Chorus]
Because there's nobody else
That can make me feel the way you do
I promise I'll always be true
So when you feel the need to love
Let me be the one you're thinking of
Because I will make it so right

[Chorus]
Forever and ever
I will always be there for you
Forever and ever
I will always be there for you
Forever and ever
I will always be there for you, baby

[Bridge]
To be with you is all I ever hoped for
You can teach me so very much
And I can show you a few things too
Yeah, I guess it's true what you said about the other night
You know about me growing into a woman
But it's not just me
We're growing
But I wanna let you know
No matter how far away you go
Rain or shine
I'm yours and you're mine
And I will always be there for you

[Outro]
There'll never be another
No, uh, uh, uh
There'll never be another for me
I will always be there for you
