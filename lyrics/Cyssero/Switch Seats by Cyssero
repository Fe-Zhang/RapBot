[Intro]
Wonder what the fuck is going on with hip-hop
Ooh, somebody call me when the shit stops
Ooh, Weak Millz, should've keep your lips locked
Ooh, should've kept his fucking

[Verse 1]
I know you, it really wasn't in your mind you will win
But fuck it, respond to him again, don't take the bomb to the chin
The chance to outrap the number one artist, can't get the job done?
Nigga, you in the need of a game winner, you better lob one
What's the point of pointing out he's got a ghostwriter
When you ain't come close to being more fire when you wrote 'bout him
But yeah, I know, I know, you got M's, you a Ghost buyer
The boy L gonna haunt you like you saw a ghost by ya
What a mistake, why take a poke at the champ?
You're only good for Twitter fingers and emotional rants
He got Views From The 6, I want views of your face
When you hear you're going down in history for losing to Drake

[Hook]
You can't finish what you started beef with the nigga
Hope the 6 God make you switch seats with the nigga
Not to mention Drake is 'bout to 3 Peat on you, nigga
Damn, you might as well switch seats with the nigga
Why you let the city down, we lost belief in you nigga
Come back to the underground, switch seats with the nigga
Why you let Drizzy Drake bar beat on you, nigga
Oh god, somebody better switch seats with you, nigga

[Verse 2]
Dreams Worth More Than Money, album was hot
But that damn Wanna Know diss kinda is not
Wait, niggas know you cannot fuck with Drake, they'll bet everything
And tell the homies they can't yes everything
C'mon stop that, your shouldn't have let him drop that
There are millions of hip-hop fans watching, y'all got to watch that
You got that? The whole fucking world is watching
No, fuck that, nigga, your fucking girl is watching
On your shot in a diss, don't get sunk, you got to drown niggas
Treat it like it's too loud in the room, hold it down, nigga
It's not a diss, I'm trying to tell him things
To help him, do the street guys a favor, lose the belly ring
Yes, belly ring, Instagram
He got a pic of Rich Homie Quan and he got a belly ring
You've been waiting for this since 16 or 17
And Nicki helped your career in the bank, you want a wedding ring?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ayo man
Philly don't rock like that, bro
Niggas be dissing Philly niggas, we clean them niggas up, man
We body them niggas
We don't let them niggas get no W's, man
You are fucking ugly
