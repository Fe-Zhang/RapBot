[Intro]
2, 3, 4, okay, okay
Just gon' let the chords play, let's go

[Verse 1]
You asked a question and I ain't gonna lie
I wasn't ready still you took me by surprise
You want to know if I will ever leave your side
But I will love you till the very day I die
Girl I need you, I've been needing you like air
Don't know how I would survive without you there
I could scream it loud for the world to hear
And if they call me crazy I don't care

[Chorus]
You should know, I won't go
That's the last thing you should worry about
Stay with me, till eternity
And ask only one question
Will people fall in love in Heaven?
In Heaven
Hope we'll still be in love in Heaven?
In Heaven
Do people fall in love in Heaven?

[Verse 2]
Until we're older and
Our hair is grey, when
Our bones are aching and
Memories start to fade
My love for you, will always be the same
And if you don't mind, please carry my last name
To you I'll promise, to you I'll vow
I'll pledge forever, I'm starting now
I was lost until you turned me back around
I will love for as long as life allows

[Chorus]
You should know, I won't go
That's the last thing you should worry about
Stay with me, till eternity
And ask only one question
Will we still be in love in Heaven?
In Heaven
Hope we'll still be in love in Heaven?
In Heaven
We will still be in love in Heaven?

[Chorus & Verse 3]
My baby, don't you, don't you, don't you worry about it
Cause I can't live without you
Now I confess that this is how I'm feeling
Omotosho wa ba mi lo, wa ba mi se temi
Oh baby
That's the last thing you should worry about
Stay with me, till eternity
And ask only one question
Will we still be in love in Heaven?
Hope we'll still be in love in Heaven

I wanna love you
Forever hold you down...
