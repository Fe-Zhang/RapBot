[Intro]
Some things are just never said, no
Oooh ooh ooh
Woah woah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Story of my life
Ordinary person just like you
If you take a look inside
You'll see the great things that people do
Changing lives day and night
But nothing I do ever makes the news
Still I have to do what's right
To the King of all kings, all praise is due

[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday I was on a train
A little boy asked me my name
He said "Sir, I've seen you before, tell me who are you"?

[Chorus]
Said I am a legend that you never heard of before
I said I am a lion but you never heard me roar
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name
That means I made a change

[Verse 2]
I'm the man who cooks the food and feed the street people in the afternoon
I'm the lady with the broom sweeping the halls of your sons pre-school
I'm the soldier who's up all night, making sure everything's alright
And if you ask me I'm quite fine, being a ordinary person doing what's right

[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday at the football game
A little girl asked me my name
She said "Sir, I've seen you before, tell me who are you?"

[Chorus]
Said I am a legend that you never heard of before
Said I am a lion but you never heard me roar
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name, that means

[Bridge]
I'm the ocean of fame
I'm an unknown sailor
I'm the percussionist playing with the Wailers
The one with the shaker, the mover and shaker
My name wasn't on the front of the paper
But mi nuh care cah
Much more than the work cah the work is greater
Creation glorifies Creator
So all deeds done are in the name of my Maker

[Chorus]
I am a legend that you probably never hear about
Words from the lion's mouth
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name
Give praise, that means I made a change

[Outro]
(Legend, legend)
(I am a legend)
(Legend, legend)
(I am a legend)
(Legend, legend)
(I am a legend)

Story of my life
Ordinary person just like you
If you take a look inside
You'll see the great things that people do
We out here changing lives day and night, day in day out
BBC don't show it
CNN don't show it
Ease out
