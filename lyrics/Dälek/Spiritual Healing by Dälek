Who you pray to, my God the black God?
Who you pray to, my God the brown God?
Who you pray to, my God the white God?
Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod

[Verse 1]
I wear skin like Jesus
Sick of bullshit preachers
Concerned with aborted fetus
But don't give a fuck who feeds us
Speech so tedious
If Abraham freed us
Why there still Abner Louima's?
Been slaves since days of Julius Caesar
Man's need to dominate overshadows need to breath
Pray to your pagan gods while your twisting all those trees
Scraped knees don't prove what you believe
Your blind faith passed to your seeds
Killed our garden type weeds
Turn around and blame it on Eve
While you blame me for blemishing our family tree
I'll uproot all of humanity

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sick of true blasphemy
Religion pure alchemy
And gold lines no lead streets
Blessed are the meek who reek in honesty
True green lie in botany
They're hawking me from high atop the food chain
Deciding who to blame for each and every heartless act
Weight of elements exact
I retain no tact and spit the pure fact
Mixed with blood from split tongue
Collapsed lung only help to breath diseased atmosphere
Expect me to adhere to your bullshit code of silence
Speak till dawn of violence
They say no man's an island...
Iâ€™ve watched the youth
These kids is wildin'
