[Hook]
False facades grin upon my last smile
Spit concrete bile, speak volumes on this child
False facades grin upon my last smile
Spit concrete bile, speak volumes on this child
False facades grin upon my last smile
Spit concrete bile, speak volumes on this child
False facades grin upon my last smile
Spit concrete bile...

[Verse 1]
Essence erodes into mess you believed to be real
Listen to hendrix played backwards on reel to reel
This world lost its feel when art lost its grasp
Should have paid attention in class kid
Fed off tit of deceased and still a bastard
Asked for it all and received a swift nil
Built on the ashes you burned
Placed in urns
Along with the lessons I've learned
Amount to paradox
I am where you were
Before you was my victim
Breath clorox while i rock social unconscious like Shirley Chisholm

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lost my rhythm within context of diseased cortex
Search for more sex and violence
Was met with ill silence
Childhood idols fell hard like third world tyrants
Reviving center core
Who these you adore?
Lost in urban lore
Cleanse perception's doors
Respect that film noir
Existence?
I enter/exit poor

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Voyeur's voyage considers six the blessed
Minus 55 in thousands
Two scream for fiction as they laughing
33rd degree, new continents we mapping
Ask what happened as I bleed my vocal orifice
We breathe too much nonsense
We breathe too much nonsense

[Outro]
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo I'm asking what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo I'm asking what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo what the fuck happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo i'm asking what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
MC's, what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
DJ's, What happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
B-Boys, what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Graph artists, what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo my culture, what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo what the fuck happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo I'm asking what happened?
33rd degree, new continents I'm mapping
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
Yo what happened?
The fuck happened?
