[Sancho]
Bitch you better know when I walk in the door
Pistol with smoke
We's the C-A  L-I-F-A on parol
Scoping the bitches and some sluts
Looking for big tits and some butts
Keeping an eye on my posible enemies
With my cuete tucked...what!
Mr. Sancho one of the original Califa Thugs
Used to make money by selling the drugs
Pimpin these women fill it up with slugs  uh!
Never be caught slipping and doging away from these cops
Knowing the back of my mind I'll be hot
One day hot or maybe not
Whachu gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun?
Naked women on the beach under the sun
Now tell me because if you blame me
Cause I get it paid see
I don't have to worry bout' doing some time
Cause I spend all of my time entertaining
Can nobady take it away
So when I rise be sure that I'll stay
Better keep out of my way
Or I'll pull out my friend that'll play   (Boo Yea!)
