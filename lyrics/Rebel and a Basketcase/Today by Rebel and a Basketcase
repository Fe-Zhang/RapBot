We all look for an answer
The night calls us together
And we fight
And we won’t stop, just for pleasure

You too young for the answer
You too old to remember
Do you mind if we come in?

We are today
We are the voices in your head
We are the music that you hear
We are the changes that you fear

So fuck that if they can’t play
Screw the pressure, you can’t stay
‘Cause this light burns bright and free

Running full speed into unknowns
Fighting windmills
Chasing false thrones
Come back, come back to earth and stay awhile

We are today
We are voices in your head
We are the music that you hear
We are the changes that you fear

Na na na na na na

We are today
We are voices in your head
We are the music that you hear
We are the changes that you fear

Na na na na na na na
Whoa, oh oh
Hey, hey, hey

We are today
We are voices in your head
We are the music that you hear
We are the changes that you fear
