[Intro: Christian Bale]
Think for one fucking second, what the fuck are you doing?
Are you a professional or not? No! No!
Don't shut me up!

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Ex-juvenile delinquent
Yes, relapse when I fuck with Jameson
I'm thinking 'bout death like it's pussy on my mind
And the vibe, and I'm feeling like life's so lame
Heaven's probably iller, with way more babes
Way more ways to get faded-ed-ed
My first album was emo? What the fuck
Cats tryna play me, now, I gotta show 'em what is what
I'm the one who comes when you're feeling so numb
You're the one who runs, so I'm the one who hunts you
Hoes try to run but it's so fun to confront you
I am the rager, I am forever
Half of the time, most the time, I'm blunted
If I die, it wouldn't all be for nothing
And all my life I'm doing what I wanna
So I'm livin' in the moment 'til God push the button on me

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, these niggas all talk, hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here, we ain't half-stepping (Oh no)
Over here, we ain't half-stepping
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here, we ain't half-stepping
Over here, we ain't half-stepping

[Break: Kid Cudi]
Yahh
Hey, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, ugh
Hey, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm a cold young midwest/Cleveland representer
My bitch'll take your bitch home with her
I'm hot and cold, but never lukewarm
And niggas always talking 'bout what they can do for 'em
I'm Prince Akeem, royal penis stay clean
All the shit that I seen, you can only daydream
Running my city since I was 18
The coldest, so fuck what a hater might think
Chilling on the higher side of the clouds
Life was nothing like life is now
Just wanna have a couple dollars on deck
And change they perspec', I'ma aim for the neck
In the club I see you niggas jumping up and down sweating
Only for attention—pathetic!
You only paid $1,200 for that old school
Name-dropping-ass nigga, don't nobody know you

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, these niggas all talk, hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here, we ain't half-stepping
Over here, we ain't half-stepping
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here, we ain't half-stepping
Over here, we ain't half stepping

[Break: Kid Cudi]
Yahh
Hey, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
Hey, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yuh, yeah

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
I can show you how to do this, lame nigga
Uneducated nigga, I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this, lame nigga
Uneducated nigga, I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this, lame nigga
Uncultured motherfucker, I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do it, lame nigga
Over here we ain't half-stepping

[Outro: LCD Soundsystem]
Talking like a jerk except you are an actual jerk
And living proof—proof—proof
