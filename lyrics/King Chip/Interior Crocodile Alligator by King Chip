Now, baby, I'm the ripper, your baby daddy's worst nightmare

Louie frames, eyes lower than my GPA (Uh!)

I'm rich, bitch, but you can call me Cheap tha Ripper (Hahaha)
Shell toes, yes, Prps
There's a man riding a horse on top of my chest (Okay)
Polo fresh, I am ze man

Rolled past Dave, told him "Hello" and "Hey"

Skateboarders grind, I grind, too
That's why you can catch me in DC shoes (Nigga)
I quit the team but believe I'm ballin'
Want a verse, put up a stack or quit calling (Haha)
30's on my Chevrolet, call me super duper (Ah)
Garage like Roots, I got more whips than Kunta (Haha)
Riviera sitting on the Bulls' best hooper
Y'all still riding 20's, y'all some Oompa Loompas (Woo!)
Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
My four 15's woke up the neighbors
Interior crocodile alligator
