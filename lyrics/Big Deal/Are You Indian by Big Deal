Who are you? What you even doing in here?
Pardon my ignorance, but lately too many immigrants in India/
Did you sneak in through the border, you look chinese/
I ain't racist, I just judged u based on how your stupid face is/
See, you got little eyes and no eyebrows/
What you think you Indian? Ha, I doubt/
What you think you Indian? Why, how?
Looking for the Indian, well, you staring at him right now/
Your girls dress provocative and party all night/
& when it leads to rape, y'all rally, alright/
Like, that's gonna make a difference, I'm sick and you're the sickness/
Most of you college kids just, alcohol and weed addicted/
You can say it's none of my business and I'm a frikking hater/
But I hate your loud music and I'm your frikking neighbor/
Most of you come to college, in pretext of gaining knowledge/
While all you do is just bunk and continue draining wallets/
Waste your time playing DOTA/
You still gon find a job, thanks to S.T. S.C. quota/
Living off government's sympathy/
Losing dignity like you lost your virginity, it's sickening/
& surely it was early, especially for your girlies, right? *2
Oh & to hell with you and your smelly food/
Every time you cook, it smell like yellow poop, makes me wanna puke/
You don't eat unless it's meat involved/
Chicken ain't good enough, so you eating dogs?
Sometimes you tryna to fit in, sometimes you tryna be different/
Sometimes you tryna be western, sometimes you tryna be Indian/
All I'm tryna say is all of this is very conflicting/
Why don't you make up your mind and then make a decision/
Be the person that you wanna be, really from within/
Not just be somebody cus it's convenient and play the victim/
This is the very reason for your region's terrorism/
You fighting for your rights, yeah, very convincing/
Man, stop the killing/
Oh & something's weird about your race/
You claim to be a man, I see no beard is on your face/
I hate the law, don't believe courts/
Justice is blind and blind is the key word/
So why, criminals running free for? & innocents wanna be heard?
While they imprisoning us 5 years for using the C word/
& we love Mary Kom/
Cus she represents her country and not just where sheâ€™s from/
It is necessary if we were to ever share a bond/
And care about each other, like our very own/

Are you Indian?
Do you wanna be Indian?

I am me, tryna fit in as an Indian citizen/
I can't pardon your ignorance for thinking I'm an immigrant/
I live by the border, the left side, of course/
You judged me by my face so it clearly makes you a racist/
Arunachal, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram
Meghalaya, Tripura, Sikkim and Nagaland/
This is the North east, seven sisters of this land/
We belong right here, not China or Japan/ no!
Living better but you feeling bitter/
Little eyes but I can see the bigger picture/
A bigger vision, maybe one day we can be together/
Coexisting in harmony cus we just sick of terror/
Josh mein hosh khoke, ladkiyon ko deta dosh/
Unke dress se bahot zyada choti to teri soch he/
Insaf ke khatir road pe, rally karenge roz/
Jab tak mile mulzim ko dund, rok sake to rok le/
We were historically oppressed, so horribly in excess
Inequality and a mess/
Discriminated, as minorities suppressed/
So, the authorities chose to give priorities to us/
Simple words: we deserve all the quota reserved/ *2
We ain't living off sympathy, if you ever feel differently/
Go and raise the issue at the ministry instantly/
Some of us try to fit in, some of us try to be different/
Some of us wanna be western cus you don't let us feel Indian/
All I'm tryna say is you put us in this very condition/
Why don't you make up your mind and then make a decision/
To let us be who we wanna be, really from within/
Let us be somebody with no restrictions or be the victim/
This is the very reason for our region's terrorism/
Yeah, we fighting for your rights cus the government isn't/
So, fuck the system/
Hail mary, this male's hairy and smells very/
Shitty, no wonder our women find you real scary/
When Gandhi got thrown off the train cus of his skin color/
That's the type of racism that's always been under/
The Britishers divided us and they left/
& up until this day, we still follow their steps/
We are slaves to our pride, where innocents pay the price/
Violently take a life, another mother she cries/
Another daughter is raped, another son has just died/
All of this sacrifice, just to prove who is right/
What's the point to be alive, if this the meaning of life?
If we keep up with the fight & never see eye to eye/
Let us be human, as humans, we empathize/
It's time to bring a change, it starts with you and I/

I am Indian/
Let me be Indian/
