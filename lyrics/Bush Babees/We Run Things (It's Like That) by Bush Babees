[Hook]
Its like this y'all, Its like that y'all
We represent the hip hop, but not the rap y'all
Its like this y'all, Its like that y'all
We represent the hip hop, but not the rap y'all
Its like this y'all, Its like that y'all
We represent the hip hop, but not the rap y'all
Its like this y'all, Its like that y'all
We represent the hip hop

[Verse 1: Babe-B-Face Kaos]
Back in the days before I signed a line
When the babyface never got paid to rhyme
When Kane released Raw and everything was fine
Before the rap industry messed with my mind
I used to run to the jam snot nosed and all
Never tried to be hard, never tried to play the wall
MCs grab the mike tap the head and begin
Flowed for four minutes then passed to the end
But nowadays cause rap pays
You got a million rappers and a thousand DJs
All wanna talk about how much they flip
Runnin off at the mouth so much ya tongue was kicks
But thats aight, I represent the real hip hop
Because rappers just rap but MCs get props
And we run styles no styles no run we
Bush Babees run things represent who ya be

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Y-Tee]
Its a every style, nah gon live like people do
Now make a new style from run you
How does the Ambush crew a-pass through?
I make we tell them what fi do
Me say mercy, worse he
Bitter like circy
No have to bust a shot to make a next man hear me
Rush me, comin' from the music industry
Everybody wan fe be a bad man, them crazy
Easy
[?] an MC
A why do dem, a why do dem
Them would-a use we, nah just fe reach the top rung
But in the know we know we never sell out fe dem
They ask dem the question and its like them hear den
If reggae music and hip-hop upon friend
A message we uh send
To tell the all uh dem
United with [?] or divided [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Man]
Its been a while since you heard somebody rhyme like this
The fortified mental grimy that you can't dismiss
At the top of the list because the masses insist
Its a must that I create to elevate from the abyss
The mind must be nourished so the truth can flourish
As the rubbish is discourage by the explosional floodage
Of my verb as I infiltrate your state the least when the energy's released
You can tell its coming from the East
So cease with your ranting and your raving
And all the misbehaving that you claim with your name
In order to maintain
That status on the mike apparatus
Everybody wants to try to sound the phattest or the baddest
Thats not the case when your standing face to face in the place to be
With the face to see from inner space, so
Face the facts and tell truth to the nation
Mr. Man and thats my representation
