[Y-Tee]
Is it East and West? I ask you original the best
Well I don't know what's with all this stress
Got up in the morning many man a contest
And so I think 'em

[Hook]
Everybody want the same thing one day
Everybod want to be number one    (x2)
Rudebwoy you wanna be number one
I'm gonna run it down the line one time

[Verse One: Lee Majors]
We in this modern day Babylon with empty palms
I think about my last dollar while you holler for these rap songs
I'm in my Eden when I rap about what I believe in
No deceivin' Illuminati got that ass thinkin'
Should I even rap or will I ever blow
Or should I take the loot I got and call a cab and go?
Cause now-a-days you can't smile up in your video
I'm livin' off sour milk and cold cereal
My moms stated that life is what you make it
Hold everyday sacred I'm filled with such hatred
Cause a lot of niggas in the east don't represent
And out west I saw a few that was fraudulent
Hesitant to give a man a pound and step
Cause when your songs don't bump
They look through that ass like fish net
With no respect how could you look up in the mirror?
The world is looking shady and the future's no clearer, so

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Y-Tee]
Now as dem rumors dem spreadin' I want a single now-a-day
Everybody want to the king but no man want to work
[?]


[Hook]

[Verse Three: Mr. Man]
It's time to invent the future cause there ain't nobody else
Who can make it happen right so make it happen for yourself
Instead of stressin' everything the next man got
And trying to blow up the next mans' spot
And always actin' like you got a whole lot
When the fact is that you're trying to be something you're not
Yo if you don't cut it out you're gone be forgot
Cause the madness got to stop
See life is kinda stressful
Especially when you're trying to be successful
So many twist and turns it's like you walkin' on a pretzel
Yet and still I swear to build by any means
Mr. Man the Non Ether represent for Elohim
And you don't stop

[Hook]

[Outro: Lee Majors]
Yeah it's like gravity check it out one time y'all
It's what it means to me
It's like that ch'all. It's like gravity
