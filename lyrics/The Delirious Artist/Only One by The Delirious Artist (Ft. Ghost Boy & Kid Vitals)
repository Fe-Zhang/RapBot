[Ambience]

[Intro]

[Chorus]



We could lay here
I won't hurt chu
Give me one chance
Sanity to come to

[Verse]

< GhostBoy :( >

Please take the pain away
Wish u could stay
I won’t complain about the rainy days
I’ve got the strength
To Live and not to break or fade away
Fuck what they say
And I Won’t let u down
Ur all I want
My words profound
Am I enough
To be around
I’m gonna stunt
Look at me now
I’m coming up
I’m smoking loud
Come roll a blunt
I’m already

[Pre Chorus]

< GhostBoy:( >

High up in the clouds
Ain’t no way I’m coming down
Fuck what they talking bout
Everybody talk for clout
So I Stay by myself
I can’t let em catch me out
But u can come around
Ur the only one allowed

[Chorus]



We could lay here
I won't hurt chu
Give me one chance
Sanity to come to

[Verse]

< GhostBoy :( >

I think that she’s losing interest in me
I overthink bout the things that I see dreaming about what I am  gonna be
I’m just playin the cards that were handed to me
They talking down but I don’t let it get to me
Fuck all the shit in my past that is history
Gotta keep moving forward ain’t no missing shit
Time never stops so I will make the best of it

[Bridge]

< GhostBoy :( >

Yuh just leave me alone better off by myself
When I am with u my heart starts to melt
Know when I lose u my life will b hell

[Chorus]



We could lay here
I won't hurt chu
Give me one chance
Sanity to come to

[Outro]
