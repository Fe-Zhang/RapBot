I gotta free my mind (4X)

I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
Yeah, I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
Yeah? I gotta free my mind.. free my mind

[Verse 1: Evocalist]
From sand docks to auction blocks to R&B
From hip-hop, how many rappers flip-flop to get props?
Signed the dotted line but didn't read through the costs
(When your album sits on the desk) "That's when ya lost!"
Followed your label's notion, no promotion, now you're audi
And that's the type of moves that make an artist act rowdy
Emcees fallin victim to financial, seduction
Then watchin' creative weight extracted like liposuction
Your A&R like C&R got many styles to suit ya
But if it's false to me, I've never been an ass smoocher
Since I don't brainwash minds with talkin' nines and how I shoot ya
It seems no multi-million dollar contracts in my future
Others swallow the bait and get gassed like petroleum
But contracts break like Rock Steady on linoleum
No actin' in my format, no Grammy awards
Rap over break loops and samples, no R&B chords
On a mission from God to make the conscious souls nod when I'm rhymin'
I take tracks of coal and then compress 'em to a diamond
I'm in the mindstate to escalate
When all rappers participate, it's fate for rap to elevate

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I gotta free my mind (yo as a matter of fact)
I gotta free my mind (we're not goin' out like that)
I gotta free my mind (we got the power to stay)
"Other rappers, they went slip slidin' away"

[Verse 2: D. Wyze]
You're goin' downtown to leave your mark on the biz
You reminisce, you and your A&R was first friends
You got talent and you ain't afraid to splurge hip-hop
Better thrills than Jordan alley-oops the pill, but still
Got verbals like murder, so call up Perry Mason
Twenty-five to life is what I'm facin', for this fate's in
The element of fine print, I've read it and overseen
By judgmental pompous ass phonetics, the critic
I'm still the rapper for the rhymes that he expresses or manifestes
No frontin', I wrote the shit while blunted
Take control, don't be a fuckin' fish on a pole
Labels'll leave you murdered in a river with no soul
It's true, for what you say is what you do with the flow
For labels, MC's come and they go, but B.U.M.S
We leave our mark for hip-hop's devastation
And I strive to stay alive for my record's elevation

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
Yeah, I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
Yeah? I gotta free my mind.. free my mind
