[Hook]
We no run, we no hide, we no play around [?]
You shouldn't diss, no, you'd get murked, forensic [?]
We no run, we no hide, we no play around [?]
You shouldn't diss, no, you'd get murked, forensic [?]

[Verse]
I said blocka, blocka, fucker, everything I'm on
Jumper, jumper, or y'all can sing along
Well, get your brain right
I'd have them in the pain like
Whatever she said, ooh, boy, you'll be deader than dead
I shot Dre in the head, took the bread and the lambs spread
See, y'all don't get it through your damn head
Until you scratching your temple and say, "look, why my hand's red?"
Turning your man and all that your man said was
Well, 40 like Lenox, on Lenox Ave. shit
Your boy faster than a Lennox jab
And I been dropped that ten blocks you cannot pass
And gotta do and say my name and all this shit, I'll blast
40, I don't play around
I just lay them down and...
*three gunshots*

We no run, we no hide, we no play around [?]
