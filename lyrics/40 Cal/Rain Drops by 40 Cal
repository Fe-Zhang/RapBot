[Intro: The Temptations]

Cause day after day, I spend locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
I wish it would rain

Freh, 40, let it rain, let it rain

[First verse: 40 Cal]

What you know about wet money
Getting money all wet
Its like my watch looking drenched with flooded with baguette
Freh, dipset, skin

Look it was a hot steamy night, baking in the summer
Praying that it rained, then came the thunder (please rain)
D's on patrol, they waiting for the hustlers (squallay)
No money coming, and the agents under cover
Cuz whenever it rained, we got hard cane to flip (hard cane to flip)
So when the feds came, make it hard to take flicks (cheese)
I used to pitch in Colombian rain coat (Ok)
Now I'm gettin hit with Colombian king coke (ok)
Now the block flooding, no wonder we ain't broke (no way)
And we can't stop the rain, not even a plain pose
Not a game goes (how we go), it started to thunder
Get lightning independent, what umbrella you under? (knock 'em out)
Shit, I know lighting don't strike in the same spot (no)
But that's twice he got knocked and getting shot (oh)
On the same block the chedda and he came throwed up in the club singing let it rain
And it ain't a thing

[Interlude: The Temptations]

Rain, aww let it rain
Rain, rain, rain
Ooooooooo
Let it rain, aww let it rain
Rain, rain, rain
Ooooooooo

[Second verse: 40 Cal]

Let it rain, rainy days i sit back (pouring)
Dreaming of getting big stacks like jersey city
You see me, where the bricks at?
Shit, why you think a nigga wristrap? (why)
All these diamonds flood my bezzle, like lightning hit that (bling bling)
My brains are stormed, raining on, Im like Genghis Khan
I made a song that most hated on (most hated on)
That's why my paper long, like toilet tissue rolls, (shit)
Why you love me long time, like oriental hoes?
Fucking with Jim Jones, boiling with the pros
Still wet the block up like bordering the holes (get wet)
Writing that I do, has my eyes looking like sky blue
So saying that you betta, mean that lightning will strike you (blaouw)
Make it rain 40 days and (40) 40 nights (40)
Get under my umbrella cuz that fella 40 nights (ok)
That jealous of the ice cuz they diamonds looking cloudy (can't see)
Black clouds on their head, got em feeling lousy

[Outro: The Temptations]

Rain, aww let it rain
Rain, rain, rain
Ooooooooo
Let it rain, aww let it rain
Rain, rain, rain
Ooooooooo
