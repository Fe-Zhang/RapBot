Verse 1: Marchitect
I remember I would dream about rocking a mic
Back in the days when we used to put a sock on the mic
Live to the tape deck, get it right with no mess up
Day dream in class about my vinyl getting pressed up
And then it happened and I got some new dreams
Worked hard and accomplished a few things
Just to never sleep I learned to dream while I'm awake
About my loved ones, my lost ones, and ones that went astray
People try to step on your dreams
But your dream is really real as long as you believe
Can't let it overshadow your reality
Then you living lies and to your dream you're a casualty
Sometimes I close my eyes
And I dream I can touch the sky
And I know that I can
And I know that I will
Do you know what I'm saying

Hook: Marchitect
I'm still dreaming even when it's no meaning
I like dreaming
Even when it's no meaning, you know I'm still dreaming it's true
Dreaming of you
I'm still dreaming even when it's no meaning
I like dreaming
Even when it's no meaning, you know I'm still dreaming it's true
Dreaming of you

Verse 2: Jas Mace
At times through meditation my mind drifts away and starts racing
To a land where there's no races, and no nations
No imaginary lines to abide by
Everything is peace, no money to divide by
A place where cash is non-existent
Where money really ain't a thing there's no need for business
And religion's very primitive
No talk of god's rapture or the fear of all his punishments
We just exist without the drama of politics
No suffering in this state we let go of our attachments
And relationships is universal
We're all connected to the universe as one it's quite enlightening
A feeling that's foreign since we were born in this place
A return to the essence let it drift away like the incense smoke
Where you can find happiness
So close your eyes and enjoy the state of nothingness

Hook: Marchitect
I'm still dreaming even when it's no meaning
I like dreaming
Even when it's no meaning, you know I'm still dreaming it's true
Dreaming of you
I'm still dreaming even when it's no meaning
I like dreaming
Even when it's no meaning, you know I'm still dreaming it's true
Dreaming of you
