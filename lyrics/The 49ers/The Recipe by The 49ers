I got drum kicks in the mix, my drum sticks in my chick
Cause she’s thicker than thick like when you mix the Bisquick
What more can I say, except everyday
I’m known to be holding pot like Rachael Ray
The way I cook a flow I might need a cooking show
The top of a building I’m strictly crushing pink cookies though
The 49ers, we chef it up with a buzz man
Since we was 13 like a backer’s dozen

Before I even start a verse I season the beat first
And let it sit a couple days in the marinade
As the flavor sinks in I get ready to begin
Grab a pad and a pen put the ingredients in
Then mix it ‘til it’s hot, there’s a lot you don’t see
That goes on behind the scenes like a movie screen
Like the preparation, sweat and dedication
Make sure it’s all good for the presentation

This is how to cook a classic up
The ingredients for a classic cut
The beat got flavor and the rap is tough
But the fans are so hungry that it’s never enough
The DJs are on it and they’re mixing it up
It’s just the right blend to have you turning it up
No matter if you copped it or you’re burning it up
The way we’re heating it up, they just be eating it up

This the organic, no preservatives are needed
Fast food emcees, y’all can keep it
And leave it on the shelf it ain’t good for your health
No artificial flavors we’re official major
And labeled as kosher nobody comes closer
To a home cooked meal that makes you feel how you’re supposed to
So no matter how you dice it
When it comes time to cut it, we let DJ SLICE it

My flavor splash on your speaker like a dash of paprika
So the new ish can rock from Delaware to Massapequa
I wrote it at the kitchen table
Two syllables away from when I’m about to diss your label
We’re over top of y’all like an apron
And dwell up in your temple like the great Mark Macon
Bringing home the bacon like police chauffeurs
Y’all dudes are small like mini me’s hors d’oeuvres
