Verse 1: Marchitect
Brother my rhymes the rap that it slaps the black actor
Five seconds into the flick the sick rapper
Mad suckers running their lips like Mick Jagger
I gotta deal with Duracell because of how they get battered
They're cartoon rappers only right they get splattered
Only right they get madder than cattle or the hatter
They're like the president because what they say ain't never matter
I sever matter, like a professor breaking atoms
They slept in when I crept in but now they're up and at 'um
Like a No-Doze overdose straight got comatose
Wash all up like dirty water rolling over stones
It gets deep like Oliver Stones overtones
It hits close to home give your bones a jones
All year round slamming suckers like Bones Malone
I do a show then hit the road like a motor home
So never let it happen like you see me sitting home alone

Hook: Marchitect
Champagne for my real friends, and real pain for my sham friends
The 49ers got 'um crammed in
Every beat that I fuck with is slammin'
In every country, every city that I land in
(x2)

Verse 2: Marchitect
You holding on the words that I didn't say
You ain't gonna hurt nobody like Kid N Play
Playing hoops the only way you gonna move a brick a day
Why front, you know you need to sit and pray
Because I do do a lot of bullshit in a way
Of getting a pay, getting away, catching a ray
With a fox like Jamie get the box and just play me
Need the brother with the knock never hesitate to say me
Stab a meet decathlete dismantle the sport
And I kill a cut like Emanuel Stewart
Cause I was destined to flip it like the channel before
You know the one who wack rappers' galore and further more

Hook: Marchitect
Champagne for my real friends, and real pain for my sham friends
The 49ers got 'um crammed in
Every beat that I fuck with is slammin'
In every country, every city that I land in
(x2)

Bridge: Marchitect
New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Atlanta
Can't forget Miami, Houston this is going out to LA and Chi-town

Verse 3: Marchitect
Yo I got my hand up in the right pot put my feet up in the right spot
Move like a cheetah when the night drops
I beat a rapper cataract towards a Cyclops
You're full of air just like the back of fucking hi-tops
Or mop tops give me the top pie
So why you so surprised your girlie has to stop by
And it's a shame to see the world going loco
Like Tone Loc with an Uzi on train to Acapulco
You finally got you lute, you ready to shoot up
You ready to get your jewels snatched like Montezuma
And I presumed the punks spreading all the rumors
Hide and go inside when I'm spreading all the tumors
And tremors and dilemmas when the quake fucks the room up
You hear the glass is dropping you awake and pick the broom up
Damn, just to think last week
You was the world's best rapper rapping over wack beats

Hook: Marchitect
Champagne for my real friends, and real pain for my sham friends
The 49ers got 'um crammed in
Every beat that I F with is slammin'
In every country, every city that I land in
(x2)
