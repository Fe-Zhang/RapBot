Intro: Jas Mace
Yeah it's one of those, yeah

Verse 1: Jas Mace
She was my girlfriend's best friend
Knew of them from back then
Back when they hated each other
But now they're closer than brothers (uh huh)
What makes it harder didn't want to be a part of it (nah)
I knew deep in my heart if she started I would have parted it
And now here comes the arguments
Fighting over every little thing looking for an excuse to cut her loose (yeah)
Shit I know she's with it always giving it a little bit too much
A little too touchy feely you feel me
And I can see it in her eyes the way she smiles
The way she sips her drink then licks her lips it's something devilish
And yeah it's pretty selfish but fuck it I'll pack it up like shellfish
And escape to my fantasies on a private beach (yeah)
With me and her but then the thought occured in the back of my mind
That sometimes I'm probably mixing up the signs (uh oh)
So this time I thought I'd show up unexpectedly (oh man)
Only to see my girl and her girlfriend getting freaky to some Jodeci

Verse 2: Marchitect
Yo, yo you see my girlfriend's best friend is cold stacked
With a fatty back the big breast and
I caught her looking at the barbecue
Holler at her, yeah I think that's something that I ought to do
Matter fact I think I should't though (shouldn't though)
Cause even if she's feeling me you know it couldn't grow
But see I know the girl's a freak on some hot ish
Because my girl done put me up on all the gossip
So see I know about all your escapades (escapades)
And the things that you be doing in your Escalade (Escalade)
And plus I know your man is worthless (worthless)
And we could keep a secret just like the service
But nah, I'll have to keep it just a fantasy
Even though you know I'm fiending for you frantically (yeah)

Me, you, my girl getting freaky puffing cali weed
