Hook: Jas Mace & Marchitect
Life's too short when you're living too fast
Moving full speed trying not to crash
Can't fall can't slip can't slip can't fall
Keep one eye open can't sleep at all

Verse 1: Marchitect
He was my homie, late at night we'd ride
I knew that he was riding dirty contraband on the side
Of the driver's seat, he'd like the way I'd ride a beat
A brother from another mother but he'd dwell inside the streets
No jump shot, no college, no flows
A natural born hustler that kept a low pro
A little loco, I ask'd why you living so fast
He replied, why you living so slow
You know we both laughed
Life's a little funny when you got no cash
He took care of his girl's kids the burden he would bare it
They wasn't even his, a previous marriage
Common law got it all from the street life
Said he would have rapped but he could never stay on beat right
I hate to see him ducking cops under the stress
Because the situation in the inner cities is a mess

Verse 2: Jas Mace
There's a girl in my neighborhood
Trying to do everything that her neighbor would
She sits alone on the stoop and watches
Parents ain't around no influence to stop this
She want to do what grown women do
But she's a little confused 12 years old been raised on rap music
Her self image is gimmicks and material living
Half naked women sex and money spending
Education ain't making her dollars, it ain't problem
Because her body sells more than flipping burgers at McDonalds
She's in the fast lane everything sideways is just a blur
It's how tunnel vision occurs
Another casualty childhood fatality
Robbed of her innocence missed out on being a kid again
So slow your roll like rotisseries
Before it's too late to even listen to me
