Hook
Never before have I trusted my emotions
Oh darling, to think I'd ever learn the real meaning of devotion

Verse 1: Jas Mace
Do you remember how we first met? Out on the playground
I pulled you by your pig tales and laughed at all your hand me downs
But you were cool and knew exactly what to do
Wasn't scared to bust back cause you made fun of my front tooth
I lived on the 5th you moved into the 6th
New to the complex your family was a mess
I used to hear your parents fighting every night through the walls
They were paper thin
When you and Danny did the nasty, yup I heard it all
The big and the small
We became best friends exchanged secrets and all
My girlfriends would get jealous always thought that we were hooking up
I told them you were like a sister but they never listened
Though at times I thought about it and what it would be like
Didn't want to lose a good thing so I kept quiet
Now we're all grown up, doing grown up things
I never trusted anyone like you so what you think hun?

Hook
Never before have I trusted my emotions
Oh darling, to think I'd ever learn the real meaning of devotion

Verse 2: Marchitect
Aye we're gonna take it way back with this one man, back in the day
She sat behind me in English so fine and distinguished
Come and find me and kick it all the time she would visit
My locker back then her special best friend
Some people know me good now, see she knew best then
Trading answers to the questions passing notes in my direction
Scoop it up, send it back when the teacher wasn't looking
Pick me up in daddy's pick up your sister was the 5th wheel
In the movie theater none of us could even sit still
This will last forever's what I hope
But nothing lasts forever's what I know
Sometimes I wish I played my cards just a little different
You're grown with a man, a couple little children
And a dog in the back yard
I go on tours I'm a rap star
Across the world I took it that far
Every now and then I get a memory of her
And time and time again so frequently they reoccur

Hook
Never before have I trusted my emotions
Oh darling, to think I'd ever learn the real meaning of devotion
