[Verse 1:The Outfit]
When I was smaller, couldn't wait to get taller
Just to get the joint jumping like the great fat [?] (twalla)
Sometimes I got in trouble when I played outside
Like the streetlight came on and I stayed outside
I don't wanna play with matchbox
I wanna have a book of matches with a [?] when I'm hanging at the rap spot
A little below'it all, acting twice my age
And still playing video games twice a day
I'm tired of being tagged along
The young boy they drag along
Maybe I'll get my props one day for the way I rap a song
Enough with these grown things
I can't wait to grow a little bit
And let the world know my name
No looking back for me
It's elementary
This young boy life just wasn't meant for me
I'm too sophisticated
I'm doing [?]
I'm too damn grown while I'm sagging my pants

[Hook 1]:
[The Outfit:] If I could move time forward
I would grow up really quick
Never look back and do some grown man shit
[Jas Mace:]If I could push time back I'd do it all again times ten
Like how I did it way back when
[The Outfit:]If I could move time forward
I would grow up really quick
Never look back and do some grown man shit
[Jas Mace:]If I could push time back I'd do it all again times ten
Like how I did it way back when

[Verse 2:Jas Mace]:
I wish that I could go back
Back to the days when everything was so easy
And responsibilities wasn't weighting on my shoulders
'Cause now I'm overwhelmed by bills
It sucks being older
Me and the homies used to walk the streets carefree
With no worries
But being home when the lights came on
Should'a seen the struggle in my father's eyes
Those were the days
When I only cared about video games
How I missed the old days playing hide and go get it
Now they hide and we get it
The disease without a remedy
Now we run a risk of catching felonies
No more smack on the wrist
They put a cuss on that bitch
Took a lot of things for granted
Like little bit gains
Things ain't the same
It's a shame
And I can't stand it

I guess I got a manage
'Cause ain't no turning back the clock on this crazy ass planet
