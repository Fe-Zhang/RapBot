[Chorus]
Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love

[Verse 1]
Romantic places in my mind
Hoping someday I would find the perfect one
And I could share
And then that day you walked inside
And no longer could I hide my love
I had to take you there

[Pre-Chorus]
Sailing on a cruise at night
(Sailing on a cruise at night)
Gaze into the ocean under moonlight
(Yeah, yeah)
Taking you to paradise
(To paradise, baby)
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH! YEAH!

[Chorus]
Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love

[Verse 2]
I showered you with gifts of love
But it was never enough
To bring you closer to me
Tricking money was no thing
The simple pleasure that you bring my way
Takes me back to the day we were

[Pre-Chorus]
Sailing on a cruise at night
(Sailing on a cruise at night)
Gazing to the ocean under moonlight
(Under moonlight)
Taking you to paradise
(Taking you to paradise)
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH! YEAH!

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love
