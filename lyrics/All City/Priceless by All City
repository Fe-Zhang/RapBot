[Verse 1]
I break barriers, name who? Mega fabulous
Duckin' savages, crab bitches, shade carriers
His flow's passionate, from Medina, grows accurate
Rhyme catalyst, my status, y'all ain't catchin' it
The rhyme passages we're servin', snake, serpents
Soul purchase, make diamonds, idol worship
Heinous verses, thoughts dwell under the surface
You short circuit, long range, mag to interpret
We straight murk it, worldwide, we K lurch it
Whatever urges, for this paper, feel it's worth it
A hundred percent, we throw conscious rapper [?]
With my accomplice, [?] throughout the compass
'Til we accomplish, get slick and open your carcass
The grooves target, who nervous? Who the [?]
This rap artist slumbers with a goddess
A true wifey, a few like me, can do like me
You out to end me, with the hemi
To the GA, I'm into that shit, you get me paid
Although cliche, true life, that's how we play
Stack up [?], get Ma Dukes up out the PJ
30 spins, FM, every DJ
All City, NY with the replay
Hundred 3k, give me the leeway, I'll take it from there
Brooklyn's number one

[Hook]
It's all about this
Another day, another dollar to earn
Gettin' this money is my only concern
As far as paper with the federal seal
You know the deal
A mothafuckin' fortune like the wheel
It's all about this
Another day, another dollar to earn
Gettin' this money is my only concern
As far as paper with the federal seal
You know the deal
A mothafuckin' fortune like the wheel

[Verse 2]
As the day dies another cake rise
Bitch niggas operate like gay guys
I sense the shifty ways in their eyes
Stay major high, scheme to get a piece of the pie
Some of us push coke, I just prefer to peddle white lies
I'm thinkin' likewise, the bottom line lies, this enterprise
Leave you without your assets, leave these small fries behind
Walk a fine line, for paper I grind, make up your mind
Wanna live broke all your life or wanna live big time?
Then you should roll with us, we're so high, they're only tollin' us
It's from the ice chips on the wrist
On the top of your lisp is the metropolis
It ain't no stoppin' this conglomerate from droppin' hot shit
Watch this as I profit, line my pocket with dollars, not it
Push the drop 6, I got kicks
In the high rise, suckin' some Puerto Rican mami's tatas
For beef I got guys, they move while I'm tryna watch my stock rise
Chop pies, wise guys [?] my demise
Monopolize, they cop a why five eye
Think long range, small change and all change
Stock exchange, cop the Range, pocket the change
For capital gain, niggas'll clap you in the brain
It's all in the game, so many have fallen from fame

[Hook]
It's all about this
Another day, another dollar to earn
Gettin' this money is my only concern
As far as paper with the federal seal
You know the deal
A mothafuckin' fortune like the wheel
It's all about this
Another day, another dollar to earn
Gettin' this money is my only concern
As far as paper with the federal seal
You know the deal
A mothafuckin' fortune like the wheel
