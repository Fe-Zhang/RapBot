[Intro]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us

[Verse 1]
Ah-yo, my mama she the only one raised me right
Taught me young, right from wrong, good and bad
Never knew my dad, but we had mama
Through all the drama and the rain, hard times and the pain
The type of shit that makes the average woman go insane, but you maintain
Laced her young brother on the block with some street game
Aiyyo, I never talk bad about my mother
She sacrificed and paid the price I love
No other could ever do what you did with four kids
Had to raise us by yourself because them dad slid

[Hook]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[God faced this world on you]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[mama dried your tears and be strong]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[gotta try do the best that you can]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[try to raise this boy to a man]

[Verse 2]
No more daddys around, so I'm the man
Relax, kick back, and put my feet on the couch
My pops was bangin' on the outs before my moms broke out
I smoke out and think about all the times we had, this shit was sad
Why you leave us dad, moms was lookin' hella mad
Tell me why you dissed us, birthdays and Christmas
I hope your ass is listenin', 'cause all the shit
You put us through, moms had to put us through
I hope I never resemble you, why they always tell I do
Look like you, talk like you, even gangsta walk like, but smoke you
I've never even seen you dude, probably robbed you once or twice
Back when I was livin' tryin' get out the game to follow Christ
Tell how you sleep at night, kiss your kids and hug your wife, I'll be aight
I'm grown now and most of the pain is gone now
But you never taught me nothing, you never bought me nothing
And most of the stuff I learned in life I had to learn from uncles

[Hook]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[God faced this world on you]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[mama dried your tears and be strong]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[gotta try do the best that you can]
Please let me know, tell me why you dissed us, never even missed us
[try to raise this boy to a man]

[Verse 3]
We doin' far from the Huxtable, hopin' if I ate my vegetable
That I could grow up and buy you karats one day
Takin' trips around the world and maybe a house in the bay
I wants to give it to you, let you have it your way
We shoppin' today and everything you want is yours
I'm comin' through this industry kickin' down doors for my mama
Chill go spend a week in the Bahamas
Still wonder how you did it
You was young, but stayed committed
Had my aunties and my uncles help raise me as a child
O.G. Ed and Mariel and Powell
Can't forget my grandma, God bless her soul
She kept the lights on at night in case I came back home
The prodigal son, phenomenal one
Never thought I would see 21, let alone 25
And everything you taught me I'm using to stay alive

[Hook]
God faced this world on you, mama dried your tears and be strong
Gotta try do the best that you can, try to raise this boy to a man

When the rain comes and sun goes, you will always be that special one
And when the sun goes and rain comes, you will still be that special one
When the rain comes and sun goes, you will always be that special one
And when the sun goes and rain comes, you will still be that special one
