Yeah!Yeah!Yeah!
Shit ain't never gonna stop
Ya know I mean
Everyday, All day Soldiers on the battle field

[Verse 1]

From the cradle to the block, it don't stop until I'm gone
Catch a hot to the dome, I'm married to the microphone
And leave the streets alone, so save the bones for Harry Jones
Cause I'm hungry, I'm never lonely
My dogs and my guns keep me company, the path get bumpy
It's lonely road up to the top, I start to really feel it Pac
When he said fuck the world, cock the double barrel
I got the mind of a panther, sing along to my ghetto anthem
I be reppin' this shit, the hardest nigga to spit
I drop 1-6, my future hard to predict
I got two strikes now and they would love to lay me down
Flyin' in and outta town on a true thugs passion
'til I see thugs mansion and money in large advances
Navigators and Benzes kickin' doors off the hinges
Relentless, until we in this
Just hussle and handle business 'til I'm dead go and finish

[Hook]
It ain't too many soldiers left
But I gonna rep it to the death
Until I take my last breath and all the smoke leave my chest
I'm a rep it, ain't too many soldiers left...left...left...left...

[Verse 2]

Everyday I'm on a battlefield of frontline soldiers, strappin' a holster
So all my dogs locked up in Folsom put yo fists in the air
I know you missin' us here
Just light yo blunts and make a toast if you ain't locked up
So many soldiers boxed up and poxed up and throw away the key
And I family dead and gone that I wish that I could see
But it's obsolete now, I never put my heat down
It's time for us to eat now
We street proud, a land of the lost
How does freedom really cost
Hoe we all get a piece, walk my dogs off the leash
When I'm roamin' these streets
God bless the decease, we never trust the police
So many soldiers outta reach, I hope they all rest in peace
I need an essence for myself, so I dug in syreece
Made the poverty cease, soldiers stand on your feet
I'm a rep it the death nigga never retreat
Fuck defeat, a young vet. commander in chief

[Hook]
It ain't too many soldiers left
But I gonna rep it to the death
Until I take my last breath and all the smoke leave my chest
I'm a rep it, ain't too many soldiers left...left...left...left...

[Verse 3]
Tell me where will it stop, when my cats get dropped
When they got me somewhere six covered with dirt on top
This life is full of drama, so many things that we were promised
Other nations try and bomb us cause this shit ain't fair
We stick our nose in bidness, but its problem right here
So fuck the Bush Administration, these motherfuckas is racist
Soldiers with battle faces, at ease, salute
This shit is deep root, only ride wit die hard troops
This life is basic training, ready to ride with no explaining
I'm a soldier, take my folder
I got G-Files that young block niggas that strapped and ready for war
I want the Sky Blue Bentley on the show room floor
Until they open the door, I'm still comin hardcore
Until I see thugs mansion and money in large advances
Navigators and Benzes kickin' doors off the hinges, relentless
Until we in this, just hussle and handle bidness

[Hook]
It ain't too many soldiers left
But I gonna rep it to the death
Until I take my last breath and all the smoke leave my chest
I'm a rep it, ain't too many soldiers left...left...left...left...

[Beat Goes On]
'til I see thugs mansion and money in large advances
Navigators and Benzes kickin' doors off the hinges
Relentless, until we in this, just hussle and handle bidness
'till I can't go and finish...

It ain't too many soldiers left
But I gonna rep it to the death
Until I take my last breath and all the smoke leave my chest
I'm a rep it, ain't too many soldiers left...left...left...left...

[Spoken]
Got my nigga...Big Lonely in the house
Know what I'm sayin...Tellin' you, one of the last soldiers, one of the chosen few
Got my nigga Overdose on the track...You know what I'm say, my nigga Big-Z
It never gonna stop...
We Gone
