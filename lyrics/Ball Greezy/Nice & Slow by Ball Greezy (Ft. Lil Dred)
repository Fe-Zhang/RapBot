[Verse 1: Ball Greezy]
How you make it off the porch, in them lil ass shorts?
Stomach on flat, I like to play sports
What, you drankin' them teas? or the waist shapers?
Or Dr. Miami? it don't matter you can get it, huh
See we can smoke a lil something, we can drink if you like
You the baddest girl, the baddest I done seen all night
It's only right I make sure you good
Just relax a lil bit baby, this my hood, huh
Shot after shot, then we got closer
Last I remember we was standing on the sofa
Telling me she too drunk to drive back to Boca
Grinding onto me like she dancing the Soca

[Chorus: Ball Greezy]
Nice and slow, nice and slow, uh
Nice and slow, eat it up, beat it, eat it, eat it up
Nice and slow, nice and slow, huh
Nice and slow, nice and slow

[Verse 2: Ball Greezy]
Out of all of these hoes nigga why you up in my face
Better grab you a bitch, bend her over and make that ho shake
Get her poppin' that shit, drop it down to the ground, to the bass
Put your hands in the air and slang that dick in her face, huh
Get another drink, smoke another blunt
Get up in your vibe, 'cause these hoes wanna fuck
This my number, you can text me, you and your friends
Bust it on your bestie, let me see you get it in, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Ball Greezy]
Nice and slow, nice and slow
Nice and slow, eat it up, beat it, eat it, eat it up
Nice and slow, nice and slow, yeah
Nice and slow, eat it up, beat it, eat it, eat it up

[Verse 3: Lil Dred]
You my baby, when I'm with you girl that's bae day
Every time we take a trip, that's a bae-cay
We don't never pay attention to the naysay
Let them rumors fade away like MJ
Keep your eyes on me, girl don't look away
I got that magic stick, I'll take your pain away
Lil mama booty real soft, call her Edna Mae
Got the youngin out here thinkin' 'bout pancakes
And that booty real big like my fanbase
Goddamn, all that ass in my damn face
And I told her she can shake in a nice pace
Maybe later we can take it back to my place
Do you right baby, you can stay the night, ayy
Like the plumber, you know I'ma lay that pipe, ayy
In a nice way, yeah
Just slow it down for me
And lil mama say she wanna be my Playboy bunny

[Chorus: Ball Greezy]
Nice and slow, nice and slow
Nice and slow, eat it up, beat it, eat it, eat it up
Nice and slow, nice and slow, yeah
Nice and slow, eat it up, beat it, eat it, eat it up
