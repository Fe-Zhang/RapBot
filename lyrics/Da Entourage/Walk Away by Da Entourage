Why don't you take a break from questioning?
'cause still, you look so tired
Don't you know that you might find
Answers you don't have to inquire about?
No, I'm not second-guessing
But you know I'm not great
At addressing all my issues
Instead I shoo them all away

They still oppress me
You deserve the best me
And maybe that me still isn't good enough
But we planted too many seeds
Just to dig them up, yeah

Tell me, does this affect you?
You like to think that you can lie to me
But I see right through;
Don't hide from me
Like I'm a stranger to you, no

No, I'm no stranger than you
And we can't forget the rest of them
'cause they're all no more
And you know me
I've never been a fan
Of acting formal
So, for once, can we throw our cares away
Save the rest for a rainy day?
'cause I won't ever let you walk away
Without a word

Oh, pick your hate up from your suburb
And don't you dare dream
That you're not worth it
You're not worth it
'cause you are
And don't you ever wonder
About me here when it's over
'cause I'm not going anywhere
Without you in my arms

I'm not pretending to know
All of the answers
'cause all I know how to do
Is write some songs;
I'm no philosopher
This will always take some work
But darling do not stress
'cause the best things in this life
Are those that don't fall in your lap

I know it's crazy
Thank God we're both insane
You're losing lee
But I'm good at collecting thoughts
So maybe we're okay
Maybe we're not
Maybe we're falling apart
Maybe it's all in our brains
But I pinch myself
To make sure I'm not asleep
And I didn't feel a thing

But I'm wide awake
And I'm looking around this crowded room
And we can't can't forget the rest of them
'cause they're all no more
And you know me
I've never been a fan
Of acting formal
So, for once, can we throw our cares away
Save the rest for a rainy day?
'cause I'd be damned
Before I ever let you walk away

Oh, pick your hate up from your suburb
And don't you dare dream
That you're not worth it
You're not worth it
'cause you are
And don't you ever wonder
About me here when it's all over
'cause I'm not going anywhere
Without you in my arms
Without you in myâ€”
