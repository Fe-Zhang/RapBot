[Verse one 2x]
All the hoes with the shorts in ya ass
And ya got blue beads fallin Out yo glass
Ol' man don't want you In the club
When ya pussy pop you starting fights in the club
When you come through in a rental car
Bitches all in ya mouthand know you a star
And you come with 4 or 5 hoes
Down to fight anything straight out the door


[Hook]
They say you acting kinda funny
I heard you boppin' for that money
You say you looking for a baller
Girl come here and let me spoil ya
I'm so glad I got my own
I ain't worried bout Joeshephine
My life's a natural high
C'mon and bunny hop with me
I'm so glad I got my own
I ain't worried bout Joesphine
My lifes a natural high
C'mon and bunny hop with me

[Verse Two 2x]
You gotta make sure both hands on the floor
Then you wobble wobble pop ya ass on the floor
Then you bounce it and ya pick it back up
Now you can tell that I wanna fuck
Then you look and you say not now
But after while my boys goin down
Now your nipples and your tittys start to sweat
Girl I know ya fire pussy starting to get wet

[Hook]
They say you acting kinda funny
I heard you boppin' for that money
You say you lookin for a baller
Girl come here and let me spoil ya
