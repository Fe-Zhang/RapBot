Verse 1:

(ooooh) I tried to show em that/

I’m greatest alive They didn’t know it/

So I swallowed my pride I went and told em/

They saw the look in my eyes that I was focused/

That’s the reason that I know where I’m going/

(Unh) My people excited/

I’m looking at tomorrow I ain’t near sighted/

Underdogcentral, You need to recite it/

And if u can’t then call it math cuz we gonna have a problem/

I’m from the city of the New Orleans you know where to find me/

Uptown to be exact I got my fam behind me/

Outsiders hang around cuz my future shiny/

But if you ever fall off, that’s when they all haul off/

So I’m working hard hard & I tread lightly/

Cuz these my favorite nikes and they were kinda pricey/

That’s why the people like me (aye) I'm Always in go mode/

Gotta S on my chest like the Skype logo/


HOOK: Pull up, Pull Up Pull uuuuuuup (X4)


V2 Now I remember being broke and down bad/

Now I pay zero for my sneakers cuz I’m Al/

I fall thru to cop some shoes but first I gotta try em/

They say you like em you can take em and don't you dare buy em/

And I’m like (Woo) - What Ima turn that down?/

My music they turn up, they never turn that down/

They yelling out my name oh yea they rep that proud/

They come to my shows deep, they know I put it down/

This is true (Woo) Ima savage (Yeah)/

Power circle, I’m on another tangent/

They wonder how I do it while staying the same guy/

They tryna figure out the wave and I’m just saying hi/

A lot of people talk about the way I do what I do/

I see the envy so they love to see what you going thru/

But I ain’t hearing what you say if you ain't matching my moves/

And if you think you do it better, I got two words for you/
