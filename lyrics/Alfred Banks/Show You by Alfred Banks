INTRO:

Show you, x16


Verse 1:

I been checking you for a minute, I feel like you the business/

I feel like there’s a lot of life that you should get to witness/

I’d love to show ypu round but only if I’m permitted/

I'm ready to get down but that’s only if ya willing/

To give me all of you, never call audibles/

Cuz if your my other half that’s something you gotta do/

Be ready to twerk something, ready to work something/

Don’t love just for the money but know that that purse coming/

Know that that bag coming, I never had nothing/

So now that I got a lot of it you can come grab some of it/

Come help me spend it all, no matter what it cost/

Accomplish your wildest dream baby come get involved/

I’m seeing for that good life you gotta thirst woman/

I’m bouta take office & I need a first woman/

Come stand by my side, come be my ride or die/

I wanna be the one that can open ya eyes/

So many things I wanna show you/

So many things I’m tryna show you/

So many things I’m tryna show you/

I’m tryna open your eyes lemme show ya something/

Greatest love of all time baby I ain’t fronting/ (Repeat)



VERSE 2:

Get ya everything that ya ever been into/

Eating at those places with no prices on the menu/

You ever been hurt bad, I wanna convert that/

Logos on ya purse bag while sitting in first class/

Hit ya on the private line, I’ll Gerald Levert that/

You the hottest thing walking, I wanna assert that/

Now I gotta sweet tooth, I’m tryna dessert that/

I’ll never dessert that I want us to work yea/
