I can't, can't, can't, can't do
I can't, can't, can't, can't do
Sometimes I feel like shit
So don't waste my fuckin' time
I don't need no family just
A big fat check of royalties
I know what I wanna do
But I just don't seem
To get it through
And I can't do anything
And I can't do anything
You live like a wannabee
In this sick society
And you sitting next to me
Can't you fuckin' see?
I know how I ended up here
I took your piece of shit for real
'Cause I'm a U.F.O. Romeo
