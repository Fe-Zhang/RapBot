[Verse 1]
Back once again off the hand with my twin
And we came up with a jam for the four times ten
Can you lend me an ear for a few?
‘Cause I’ma run it down about these players in tennis shoes
Now what you gon’ do when they come to get you
When your ass is stuck in a suit and dress shoes
You just might slip, catch one to the lip
‘Cause there ain’t no traction in those Stacy wing tips
High tops or low tops, they both suit the feet
I use mine for hittin’ gates runnin' from the police
‘Cause you gotta get away, ‘cause the day they don’t play
They a stick a young brother with a hundred in a day
Don’t think that you can frame me ‘cause you banned me from your club
‘Cause a tennis shoe player gon’ always get luck
Wait ‘till I blow up, I’ma have it my way
Rent out a whole club and have tennis shoe dates


[Hook]

{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
I’m soaring to the heights in my fresh pair of airs
{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
Ready to say, we be tennis shoe pimpin

{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
I’m down with the gangsters and the hustlers and the players
{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
Ready to say, we be tennis shoe pimpin’


[Verse 2]
Grab a nigga like, I’m P.S. slide on in
Tennis shoe pimpin’ in a size nine or ten
So what up? Party people it’s time again
To get you wide open with a mic in my hand
It’s the new winner crew, geed up
With a fresh khaki suit and a fresh pair of chucks
Nigga What?
I rose up from the bottomless pit
And never stopped paying dues in this hip hop shit
See I’m a vet. Comin’ direct, you’re still wet behind the ears
Better show me some respect
While you’re sipping on this, think I’m sipping on that
Wearing hundred dollar tennis and dipping in the [?]
Some niggas tryin’ to get it but they seldom to
[?] hulk, I ain’t scared of you
I got a crew full of niggas that’ll fill your cap
40 Thevz on the mission all dressed in black (black)


[Hook]

{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
I’m soaring to the heights in my fresh pair of airs
{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
Ready to say, we be tennis shoe pimpin

{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
I’m down with the gangsters and the hustlers and the players
{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
Ready to say, we be tennis shoe pimpin’


[Verse 3]
But it ain't gon' stop till I say so
I'm a tennis shoe pimp till I'm grey and old
Same hoes over there, say you like my airs
Want me to buy you a pair?
But I can't give you nothin' but tender love and care
Ain't got no shits to spare
Sometimes I gotta scuff my NIKES up, that makes me mad
Gotta get em up with niggas that think they bad
They cost a hundred and fifty, you niggas want to get with me
Cause the bitches acting flirty, they rather envious

Haters, leave my presence
Haters, be gone
Haters, we gon' have to get on
But before you do, let go of my [?] arm


[Hook]

{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
I’m soaring to the heights in my fresh pair of airs
{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
Ready to say, we be tennis shoe pimpin

{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
I’m down with the gangsters and the hustlers and the players
{Not a preacher or a teacher or an electrician}
Ready to say, we be tennis shoe pimpin’
