Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby baby baby

Don't act like we don't feel the same
Baby baby baby

Got the whole party rockin
When they see the kid
They be pullin down their stockins'
Cus she know what it is
Yeah, I get the bed rockin

Hop up in my car
Let me get some of that toppin
And if u don't uhh
Ima look at other options
She is on my level
So she got them panties droppin'

And imma beat it beat it beat it beat it
There ain't no stoppin

Come and play with a boss
Amazing of course
I have your eyes roll back
Days then look lost

She playing with my joystick
All in my two seater
Im pushing on her buttons, yuhp
Playing all her features

I never leave her
Cus i heard that she was a keeper
So ima keep her, cus i love
How it feels when i freak her

Them other girls try
But it ain't the same
Cus she be up and down
Like a video game

She was running plays
Straight game like madden
Had me on my zone

Wait, how did this happen?

She knew i was close
To the brand like steadmen
So do it in the name, of love
Like steadmen

Lets go for a ride, baby don't be such a loser
Cus once i power up, you'll be saying that im supa
I don't discriminate, i got young ones, i got cougars

Even got a british chick, and she drive a mini koopa

Come and play with a boss
Amazing of course
I have your eyes roll back
Days then look lost

All up in her momma crib
Ki-ki--kissing in the kitchen
She knew what it was
She was acting like she didn't

Pass out to my niggas man
Shout out to Bei Maejor
They stay there right there
Watching how to be a playa

Them other girls try
But it ain't the same
Cus she be up and down
Like a video game
