Aaaahhhhh

It's time for dinner
It's time for dinner
It's getting cold

I heard you are what you eat
It's true that I must be an emcee
If I didn't eat at all well then you'd call me empty
If I ingested only brocolli I would be a vegetable
And if I chomped computer chips, then I would be quite technical
So if I swallowed dinosaurs, I would be jurassic
Plus if I dined on criminal minds then I could be a classic
Consuming homeless people i'd assume i'd be broke
Now, digesting rocks of coke, I suppose i'd be dope
If I ate a scorching torch then my name would start with 'f'
If I devoured bullet rounds then my name would be death
If I tasted Rainman's brain, i'd be super-smart
And if I ate an on-point flow, well i'd be sharp like human darts
You are what you eat!

If I ate piano keys, then I could be real musical
And if I ate up Nikki Taylor's head then i'd be beautiful
If I gulped the big blue ocean I would be aquatic
And if I gnawed Madonna's body, I could be erotic
If I snacked on world map, I guess your boy would be global
And if I munched a nuclear lunch, then I would be Chernobyl
If I did ten prison inmates, I would be in trouble
And if I chugged down dairy products only i'd be butter-fuck-o
If I clubbed on rubber plants, I might become a coper
If I drank nothing on Friday night then I would be sober
So please let it be, I ate the 60's, I'm John Lennon
And because I ate the last page of the novel I'm the ending
You are what you eat!
