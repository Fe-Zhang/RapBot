I walked in the curch
And asked a question of the reverend
No snowballs in hell?
How bout fireballs in heaven?
He looked at me puzzled… and said "hmm… amen"
And replied nonchalantly with a "hadoken"

Then he said "take that at face value ace"
Ok rev, but thats based on how that face rates
Most taste that with a grain of salt… paltry
Then complain about the grain and get salty

Faulty wiring that needs to get fixed
Im wise to the owls trick of the tootsie pop licks
Stop biting… know of your cookie jar vicks
You won't like when……. you get your prized rookie card ripped

Was on strike then
Knew it was no cookie cutter trip
Look he mutters bits pieces flipped
Until the puzzle fits
If the muzzle fits wear it on the pulpit the culprit sits
Bust through the ceiling in the clutch… fuck this


Bust through the ceiling in the clutch fuck this
Fuck this

So kept my head above the rafters
So i could see the clouds
The befores that came after
Unfriendly caspers
Pose no answers
So dear, no antlers
Go tell the chancellor

Proud tri lambda
Cool nerd to the core man
See what Im building
And this is just the floor plan
War jams pure but If the music is dull it sits
Bust through the ceiling in the clutch fuck this

So kept my my head on that held high
Took lumps and welted eyes
Survived where hell thrived
Escaped by my molar skin
That sobering moment
I am my worse opponent
Took a while to get it through my big skull its thick
Bust through the ceiling in the clutch… fuck this


So kept my head off the headstones
Found life in headphones
Zen home the endzone
Pen roams and wanders
Conjures that get grown honor
Killing off the drama I once harbored

Polish the armor
Absence made my heart grow fonder
Looking for help they asked of rhonda
It took a minute new chapters out for public
Bust through the ceiling in the clutch… fuck this

So kept my head out my ass, right?
Half right dark corridors no flashlight
You hear that laugh right?
In my past life i walked right passed life
And never paused to hear the bagpipes

Sad right?Experience breeds character
Thats mad nice
But also breeds high calibur massacre
The NRA sticking to them guns and clips?
Fuck what they dealing up such dumb pricks

Bust through the ceiling in the clutch…. fuck this
