This was all all very neccesary
Sometimes you just need to let it out right?
This is one of them times
So check it

This is one of those apology songs
Where i apologize to all the loved ones i done wrong
Pardon me a sec, because that list is type long
And I dont know where to start
In these matters of the heart

To those that pump the same blood
Fam thats you
That love for ya mom and dad
Dont always shine through
I hope you know it
And if you didn't now you do
I appreciate everything you've done and you do

Have such great friends, tho at times i dont deserve you
Emotions on lock down, dead bolts, curfews
Yall held me down even when i pushed yall away
Good looking
All that pushing getting put away today

This is the realest things I've ever wrote
Most people i dont let em close
Emotionally bellicose
Learning to let go
Eternal work in progress
Trying to get better tho
Openness a foreign concept

This is my first stamp in that passport
Turning a new leaf, sorry for being a bad sport
Late to the airport, but better late than not at all
Sick of waiting for that other shoe thats gonna fall

And to that bird out west
That sat through my stress and duress
Impossible to impress
Tough love when it was best
Didn't make it out west to your ceremony
Shoulda tried harder… bird, who better knows me?

And to that wonder that is
From the bottom of my blood pumper
Got love for you miss
You were always missed
From the second things dipped to a mess
Couldn't have handled that worse, i confess

Sorry, I can hardly say that enough
Sorry, saying it at all is still kinda tough
Sorry, thankful yall ain't ever call my bluffs
So sorry, see these connections never getting snuffed

And to my bredren that are resting in that pirate cove
That further region season was needed i was kinda cold
So tough to open up when shut down mode was all ive known
For the past few
Cashew (nuts)
Thank you for a second home

And to them fans that dig the tunes
That suffer my abuse of updates and coming soons
All i can promise is ill try and do better
It took me 6 years to see its tunes that keep me glued togther
And yall make me wanna improve
With every word i write… to every sample, chord, or groove
I know im crazy yall… of this im very sure
A little less crazed today than than the days before
I owe you all

I owe you all, fam, fans, and friends
I love you all…… the end… nah this ain't pretend
And if i never say it again… just press play
Sorry……I dont know what else to say but

Sorry,I can hardly say it enough
Sorry, saying it at all is still kinda tough
Sorry, thankful yall ain't ever call my bluffs
Sorry, see these connections never getting snuffed…
