Sometime after birth
After a very long search
I unearthed certain burdens of Tyler Durden’s self hurt
Logically you can't heal without wounds
Can't feel pain without pleasure
Or measure brains without buffoons
A wise man said
Sharp tongue and dull mind are usually found confined to the same head
Ability Is what you are capable of doing
Motivation
Determines just what you’ll do
Attitude
Determines how well you do it
Just a little theory I apply to my life style and music
A pessimist looks at this land of milk and honey
And sees only calories and cholesterol, dummy
That’s just water under the bridge you burnt
That could have been used to douse the flames if you were truly concerned
Even a firm grip slips when the task is to grasp a wish
A wish is the fish
The goal is the lure that tricks the wish to fall for hope… thats bait
A great mind is the line that pulls the fish out the lake
See the bigger the fish, the bigger the bait
The bigger the wish, the longer the wait
The more goals you make the more you can take
The more bait, the more you can hook
The more you rely on fate, the less you will cook
The less you cook, the less you eat
The less you eat, the more that your stomach feels empty and weak
The more empty your stomach the more fish you require
The more you fall and plummet the more you desire
To break free from this repetition complete
And lose site of your vision, your mission left unreached

You and your crew are so happy to punchlines
I beat paragraphs of diction To a pulp and thats not fiction Im
Giving you a brief taste
Of the glowing contents of my briefcase

If you’re uncertain and ask a question, you might be fool for a night
But dont ever ask that question and be a fool for your entire life
Fire strikes fear when near unless you are freezing
Silence is music to the ear, unless you are hard of hearing
Start cheering if your a true believer
In utilizing this artform and mic as a tweezer
To remove splinters in fingers from climbing the tree of life
To get to the top to realize the fruit was far from ripe
Infact it was rotten to the core
Shook the tree, the apple fell far from it… didn't land on the floor
Landed on Newton, my rhymes used in theories of gravity?
Is it fact or fiction? Genius or insanity?
Atoms Family packs language and facts
Perhaps traps magical raps
To make your plans crack and collapse
Into nothing
And nothing could be stranger than nothing
In the hands of a man thats damned to stay a pain glutton
I can change nothing to something with ease
Hunting MCs with brain crushing steez
Yeah yeah you better believe
My steelo
Shoot foes under the table like Greedo
Got done by Han in New Hope
Challenge Atoms language and we’ll manage to leave your crew broke

We all have photographic memories with incoming bills and cash
If we owe loot? Still photographic… with no film or flash
Take the negative develop it in this dark room
Its imperative to start soon
No wasting time
Must depart from the gloom
But pace your climb
No room for fatigue in this race through time
Im out for first place worst case
Accept nothing less
Starting point: my birthplace
Finish line: death
Call me crazy
Im that form with a kite in a lightning storm
Screaming:  ”It’s all about the Bemjamins baby”
Franklins, inventing trapping of energy
Harnessed to essentially
Charge this aggressively
Darkness broken
Pictures soaking
In liquids floating
In a boat called ambition
No fiction is allowed
This guy is disguised in the skies as a cloud
To rain on your parade and thunder loud
