Drop a clusterbomb, clusterbomb, CLUSTERBOMBS!!

"Little bomblets which, which they're brightly colored
Kids pick them up, they explode for years to come"

[Alltruisms]
Welcome to the beginning, it's me recently back
From abroad crossments of the earth, inspired awe by it all
My name is Alltruisms, that's a belief behind an idea
The reason why I chose to be called by it
Is because I'm a fan of the concept, too good for its own sake
Regardless what it will or won't make me
I faithfully take this ache and pain relief medication
Wash it down with a fifth of belief that people'll get it
Swallowin write the followin, completin unedited works
That keep gettin beatin and left for dead and it hurts
But for better or worse, actions to ashes, deeds to dust it's true
What I say don't mean as much as what I do
Another day to use in any way thinkable
On the brink of my 19th nervous breakdown, naysayers abound
But I'm discinclined to sit at home, bitch and whine and piss and moan
Take my written rhymes and go deep in some layers of sound
With no sleight of hand legendermaine
Never no way can I ever attempt to separate pleasure and pain
Destination another rainbow, estimated time of arrival unknown
Doesn't concern me, I learn more from the journey
A religion of one like it's an army, at all hours call out
Until the fallout from the bombings wipes us all out
On the swords or beats or plowshares I'll be out there on the cuttin edge
Sharpenin a metalsmith you bet I'll make my mark

So here goes nothing, beginning of the rest
Fear no nothing, imprisonment or death
Givin it my million ten percent right here today
Same criteria a lightyear away like
