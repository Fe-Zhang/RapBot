[Grandmaster Caz]
It was a long time ago but I'll never forget
I got caught in the bed with a girl named Yvette
I sure got scared like hell but I got away
That's why I'm here tellin' y'all today
I was outside of a school rappin' to a fox
A crowd of people all around listenin' to my box
Just me and the fans, and some guys from my crew
Chillin' hard cos we had nothin' better to do
It was me, JDL, AD and The All
Then I slipped away to make a phone call
To this very day it was a move I regret
But I didn't know then so I called Yvette
I said, "Hello pretty mama, it's your lover man"
She said, "Baby, come over as quick as you can"
I said, "I can't come now, fellas comin' to get me"
Then she said, "I'm all alone, there's nobody with me"
I thought for a second, 'Oh shit, she's alone!'
Then I was knockin' at her door before she hung up the phone
She let me in the house and gave me a kiss
And said, "Give me that thing that you know I miss"
So we went into her room and we got high
But she couldn't keep her hand from off my fly
So I made her lock the door and went to check it
When I came back in she was totally naked
That was my cue to do the do
I took my clothes off and started on the poon
Well I was tearin' shit up, and 'bout a quarter to three
She said, "Caz! Somebody's comin'!"
I said, "Yeah, me!"
Then the door bust open, and there was her folks
I thought, 'Damn, they coulda waited 'til I finished my stroke'
Her mother was in shock, her father reached on the shelf
Pulled down the .45, I almost shit on myself!
Said, "Please don't shoot!" and pleaded my case
Said, "You'd have done the same thing if you was in my place
But if you spare my life, believe me friend!
You'll never see me 'round your daughter again"
Don't ask me why but he let me leave
I ran thirty-seven blocks, then I stopped to breathe
Gave thanks to God he wasn't too upset
And went home and thought about poor Yvette
He must of beat her ass with everything I assume
Cos I could hear the girl screamin' all the way in my room
Even though I don't see Yvette no more
I know she ain't as fine as she was before
