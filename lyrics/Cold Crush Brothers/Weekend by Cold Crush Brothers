[All]
Everybody listen to this
The weekend's coming so don't you dare miss
You're gonna regret if you're not on the scene
And then you get so mad it'll make you scream

[Grandmaster Caz]
Everyone give us your attention please
[JDL]
Especially those of you who like parties
[Easy AD]
It's a message that we will like to extend
[Almighty KG]
About why everybody love the what?
[All]
Weekend!
[Grandmaster Caz]
Cause there's a time to work and a time to play
[JDL]
But you can't do both effectively in one day
[Easy AD]
So without delay, without further ado
[Almighty KG]
Let the four run down this week for you
[All]
We're the Cold Crush Four, giving, giving you more
And we just came to say
Oooh-ahh, what a relief it is
When the weekend comes your way
So grab a chair from anywhere
And listen while we speak
Cause the Four's gonna start this record off
With the first day of the week, [All] Monday!
[Grandmaster Caz]
The train was late and you hardly ate
Plus you wish you'd stayed in bed, [All] Tuesday!
[JDL]
You ran a game on your favorite dame
And then she messed up your head, [All] Wednesday!
[Easy AD]
You try to be cool and stay out of school
Yeah, you're fronting and showboating, [All] Thursday!
[Almighty KG]
Now your mind's in doubt, you can't figure out
Why you're not gonna get promoted, [All] Friday!

[All]
After work is through, you sleep for a few
Until you hear somebody say
[Grandmaster Caz]
Wake up, wake up, now don't you know
[All]
The weekend's when we play

This is Chase with the bass
Tone, leave the girl alone

[Grandmaster Caz]
Friday and Saturday night, everybody's gonna show
[JDL]
At the place where all the fly people go
[Easy AD]
You been working at school or your occupation
[Almighty KG]
Now it's about time for some recreation
[Grandmaster Caz]
Slip on your shirt and designer jeans
[JDL]
Say the ones that are tight at the hip and the seams
[Easy AD]
Then you shoot out the door like you're running a race
[Almighty KG]
And then you finally arrive at the Cold Crush place
[All]
And...
[Grandmaster Caz] You can't [JDL] believe [Easy AD] your eyes, [Almighty KG] cause

The party's packed and jumping
That funky bass is thumping
And the way the music rocks your mind
Ooh girl, it's really something
It's a place where you can dance
You can even find romance
And I know you can do it if you
Give yourself a chance

So-so-so-so, so just dance
All mighty all nighty, ha ha ha
JDL, well...
We gonna let you know
We gonna let you see
What we're gonna do at the party
Grandmaster Caz, I got lovin' to spare
I'm gonna chill with the ladies when I get there
Well I'm Jerry Dee or JDL
And when I get there I'm gonna rock your bells
Easy AD not talkin' no jive
And the party's gonna swing when I arrive
Well I'm The Almighty and when I get there
I wanna hear everybody cheer cheer cheer
And we're the Cold Crush Four
With Tone and Chase
C'mon everybody in the party place
Just throw your hands in the air
And just wave them like you just don't care
And if you're on the go cause we told you so
Somebody say Hoooo (Hooo!)
Hooo-hoooo! (Hoooo-hooo!)
Ho-ho-ho! (Ho-ho-ho!)

[Grandmaster Caz]
Now the lights are flashin' the people are dancing
[JDL]
The guys are looking out for some serious action
[Easy AD]
It's richer than a diamond, finer than a pearl
[Almighty KG]
And this is what happens when boy meets girl
[Grandmaster Caz]
Introduce yourself as whoever you are
[JDL]
Then you grab her by the hand and lead her to the bar
[Easy AD]
Offer her a drink, maybe a cigarette
[Almighty KG]
Til she insists conversation is all you're gonna get
[Grandmaster Caz]
Try another approach and ask her for a dance
[JDL]
Your time is runnin' out, this is your last chance
[Easy AD]
And then you sweep her off her feet with your prowess
[Almighty KG]
And then you know you got it made - finally, success
[Grandmaster Caz]
Cause we rock the best and the Four is fresh

(Oooh man that party was smokin'...)
[TALKING - NEEDS TRANSCRIPTION]

[Grandmaster Caz]
When the jam is over you head for the stairs
[JDL]
All the girls and the guys are leaving in pairs
[Easy AD]
You had such a good time, you wish you could stay
[Almighty KG]
Now it's time to catch the bus, train, or OJ
[Grandmaster Caz]
You get to your house and pull out your key
[JDL]
You're tired as hell, you want to sleep til three
[Easy AD]
Wake up Sunday, wipe the sleep from your eyes
[Almighty KG]
And go out in the sun for some exercise
Play ball, roller skate, or visit a friend
[Almighty KG]
And go home and think about the next weekend
