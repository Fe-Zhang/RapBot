[Intro: Man & Woman]
Say Honey, you wanna get that?
Okay darling
Who is it, dear?
Oh my God, it's the Cold Crush!

[Chorus]
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock rap, rap rap, rap rap, rap, rap rap, rap rock, rap
Punk rock, rock rock, rock rock, rock, rock rock, rock punk, rock
We got the punk, rock rap
We got the punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, rock rap

[Verse 1]
If you can punk, then you can rock
So while you punk, we'll rap
(Because we go it like that)
Punk rock rap
(We can do it, and so can you)
Punk rock rap
(It only takes you a minute or two)
Punk rock rap
(Now you got it, you're almost done)
Punk rock rap
(Grab someone, and let's have fun)

[Chorus]
Punk rap, rap rap, rap rap, rap, rap rap, rap punk, rap
Punk rock, rock rock, rock rock, rock, rock rock, rock punk, rock
(Start dancing to the punk rock rap)

[Interlude]
Rock rap, rap rock
Rock rap, rap rock

[Verse 2]
Shake your head, and body
If you like to party
We want you to be free
That's the way it should be
Shake your head, and body
If you like to party
We want you to be free
That's the way it should be

[Verse 3]
And if you are hot
(Call the captain and I'll show you how!)
And if you are hot
(You call the L and I'll do it right now)
And if you are hot
(Call me A girl, I'll show you the way)
And if you are hot
(Call me Almighty, or call me king)
And if you are hot
(Call 'em Chase, he got that funky ways)
And if you are hot
(His name is Tone, he'll snatch your girl from this place, she ain't no)
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

[Interlude]
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up

[Bridge]
Captain of the four [?] and that's Caz, ha ha
Heartbreaker, JDL, he-hell, hell, hell
Girl taker AD
Almighty Kay Gee

[Verse 4]
Let yourself unwind, forget your troubles
Take a little time to rock with us
Don't get left behind, just let your hair down
And do the punk rock rap with the Cold Crush
It's not hard to do, it's fun and easy
Run about the floor, so you can dance
Punk rock rap is new, the next sensation
But we're head, bring you to it in advance
Let yourself unwind, forget your troubles
Take a little time, to rock with us
Don't get left behind, just let your hair down
And do the punk rock rap with the Cold Crush
Do the punk rock rap with the Cold Crush
Do the punk rock rap with the Cold
Do the punk rock rap with the Cold
Do the punk rock rap with the Cold Crush
Cold Crush, Cold Crush, Cold Crush, Cold Crush
It's us

[Outro]
It's us, us, us
It's us, it's us, us, us
It's us, it's us, us, us
It's us, it's us, us, us
(A DJ, a Charlie Chase, it's)
It's us, it's us, us, us
(And Tony Tone)
It's us, it's us, us, us
(The heartbreaker is)
It's us, it's us, us, us
([?])
It's us, it's us, us, us
([?])
It's us, it's us, us, us
([?])
It's us, it's us, us, us
([?])
It's us, it's us, us, us
([?])
It's us, it's us, us, us
([?])
It's us, it's us
