They tried…

They tried to break you
Don't let them break you
We can rebuild you
Don't let them break you

I see the struggle
The sad look in your eyes
They love to hate you
But don't let them break, you

Because the storm
Can't last forever
You will be anything you wanted to

Anything…
Oh, anything…

Nobody asked you
What it felt like inside
Did you hate even breathing
You did what you did to get by

I see the struggle
The sad look in your eyes
They love to hate you
But don't let them break, you

'Cause the storm
Can't last forever
And the storm, oh no
Can't last forever, no, no, no

You will be everything you wanted to
You will have everything you need
You will look back at these days
And you will smile

Will smile
