(Verse 1)
Cutchy loud from inna Netherland
Wey the grabber stink like alligator pond
The scheme hot, today we a the weather man
A bwoy shoulda drop, but the Beretta jam
Long time we nuh kill a man
So we circle dem end’s like the letter man
Set a bomb, make a dam
Black rain fall, something must catch a man

(Chorus)
Daseca when the grabber hot
Scheme hot like Shabba madda pot
Shot fire every man a drop flat
Everybody strap, every pon a knock
Spin like the rims on the Cadillac
When the M1 a knock
Shot fire every man a drop flat
We around here so everybody, back-back

(Verse 2)
We badder than, everything weh bad
Madder than, everything weh mad
Black rain fall when you see we not
Steel pan a beat like Trinidad
When we step in a the street like criminal
Three duppy weekly the minimal
Funeral, dinner nam
Nobody a view don’t give a damn

(Chorus)
When the grabber hot
Scheme hot like Shabba madda pot
Shot fire every man a drop flat
Everybody strap, every pon a knock
Spin like the rims on the Cadillac
When the M1 a knock

(Verse 1 Repeat)
Cutchy loud from inna Netherland
Weh the grabber stink like alligator pond
The scheme hot, today me a the weather man
A bwoy shoulda drop but the Beretta jam
Long time we nuh kill a man
So we circle dem end’s like the letter man
Set a bomb, make a dam
Black rain fall, something must catch a man

(Repeat Chorus)
