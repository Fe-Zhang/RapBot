Hold up your head, weh you a cry bout?
'Memba you lie weh you no fi lie bout
Da lie deh too deep, cyan climb out
To how your pussy feel, make me find out
Say your brother, no the brother weh you point out

[Verse 2]
She watch me 'cause she waan fi know if medid a watch her
Fi see if me did a listen when Naomi did a chat her
But if she know me, then she know me wouldn't stop her
So even if she did have a fucked up story me woulda back her
She see Dunwell, long before him even spot her
All she see a money, like her hand middle a scratch her
Cash or credit
She'd take it if dem woulda drop her, wouldnâ€™t catch her
Get up my girl!

[Chorus]
My heart nah bruk, true, you
Fuck you
You fuck up pon me too
You fuck pon me too
Woo woo woo
My heart nah bruk, true, you
Fuck you
You fuck up pon me too
You fuck pon me too
Woo woo woo woo

My heart nah bruk, true, you
Fuck you
You fuck up pon me too
You fuck pon me too
Woo woo woo
My heart nah bruk, true, you
Fuck you
