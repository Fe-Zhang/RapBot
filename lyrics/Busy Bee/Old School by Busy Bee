We had put him in a piss pot
To see if he could swim

The brother swam to the bottom
And then he swam up to the top
The along came a spider
And beat him at the…

Cocktails, ginger ales
Five cents a glass
And if you don't like
You can shove it up…

And ask me no more questions
And I'll tell you no lies
'Cuz a guy got hit with a bag of…

We brought it way back
And the reason why we brought it way back
