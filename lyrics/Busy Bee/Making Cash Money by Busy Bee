[Intro: Busy Bee & Crowd]
Hey y'all
I want everybody to throw your hands in the air if you love cold cash money, one time, and everybody repeat after me and say, "Money, Money, Money, Money"
Money, Money, Money, Money
Here we go!

[Chorus]
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie

[Verse 1: Busy Bee]
Right now, y'all, it's time to prepare
For your number one rapper of the year
So just stop what you're doing and listen to me
I'm gonna rap to y'all about making money

[Chorus]
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie

[Verse 2: Busy Bee]
To learn to make money just listen to me
Taking advice from AJ and Vicious Lee
Buy two turn tables and a microphone
And you will never get the girls to ever leave you alone
And if this don't work, I don't know what to say
Because it worked from me, and I'm now on my way

[Bridge]
W-word to my-
A word to my-
W-word to my-
A word to my- y'all

[Verse 3: Busy Bee]
Now a lady I know who's name was Bunny
Would walk around town spending cold cash money
Bunny spent money each and every day
She had it like that since the start of me
Because her man hit the number, and it must be told
He ran out of town and left Bunny at home
He shouldn't have gone out and left her that way
Because Bunny hit the number the very next day
She called the Daily News and then they told the Post
I heard her on the phone, she began to boast
They hung up the phone and rushed to the scene
To interview her in that brown limousine
She used a six door Caddy with the TV and bar
There was a space antenna at the back of the car
I watched her tour the streets all through the night
To make money like her you had to be alright

[Chorus]
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie

[Verse 4: Busy Bee]
Money today is the root to all evil
I'm telling you the truth not trying to mislead you
It makes people act in a strange, strange way
And then they wind up in jail for 20 or 30 days
The best thing to do is just to cool out
You have a pocket full of money that's without a doubt
Because money today has gotten a little hard
So wake up in the morning and be ready to start
Now you're riding to work or going to school
Just do it every day and it'll help you
Your friends are laughing, joke
But pay them no mind cause you'll be making money all the time

[Chorus]
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie

[Verse 5: Busy Bee]
Money is funny and that's a fact
I know the party people who got it like that
The more money you make ya'll, the easier you sleep
So when you run into a man don't be cheap
I try to buy a couple houses and a couple diamond rings
Buy a pretty girl a pallet, you know she can sing

[Bridge: Busy Bee & Crowd]
I'm making money ha, I'm making money ha
I'm making money ha, keep making cash money!
And you know that!
Party people right there! (Making money)
Young ladies right there! (Making money)

Help me out now, somebody, anybody, everybody screeeeaaam!

One more time la la la la la la
Oh yeah ya'll getting money, ya'll like that right?

[Verse 6: Busy Bee]
Now people of the world making cold cash money
Listen to the busy bee cause this ain't funny
Gonna rap to you all gonna let you know
That money is here and it's not gonna go
So before I end my show I got to give you a taste
Of the man that's running first in this money making race
All the way from new york city with the voice of solid gold
The number one rapper that'll never grow old
I'm not your cartoon character, they call bugs bunny
Hear me out one time, i'm talking bout money

[Bridge: Busy Bee & Crowd]

[Verse 7: Busy Bee]
So that's how it happend in the middle of may
I bought me a jet a new place to stay
The bottle was mine so I gave it up
Yes a couple of days I ran in some luck
I found a place where I could rock it twice
So I'm down with sugarhill and I'm skating on ice
From north to south you hear it come out my mouth
From south to north when I rock back and forth
From west to east just to get a piece
From east to west cause they heard I'm the best

[Chorus]
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
