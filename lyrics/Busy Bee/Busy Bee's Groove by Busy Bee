(Intro)
Two weeks ago at the place to be
They was standing in line to to see the Busy Bee
I pulled up to the curb in the 98
Then we rushed inside so we wouldn't be late
The party was pack where you couldn't even move
Now everbody's rocking to the Busy Bee's groove
(?) ho!
Busy Bee, Busy Bee uaha!
(?)
Everybody clap your hands, stomp your feet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet

(Verse 1)
Hey, ya'll from coast to coast and from land to land
As the superfly brother with the master plan
With the beat that's unique to sound real sweet
To make you party to the rhythm seven days a week
Yes it's true that dreams can come true
If it happend to me, it can happen to you
So lets get up on our feet and let our fingers pop
Cause Busy Bee's just about ready to rock

(Bridge)
Oh ah oh a oh ah
Oh ah oh a oh ah uh

(Verse 2)
Now you heard the rest and ya'll ready to go
The baddest in hi-fi stereo
So just groove to the rhythm right groove to the beat
And you want to hear this record everyday of the week
Because the sound that you hear is so def to your ear
So have no fear, busy bee is here

(Bridge)
Uh uh awh, busy bee!

(Verse 3)
I met a young lady that fainted on the scene
She always wanted to win the lotto that was her one dream
People gathered around and asked did she move
Did she jump back to life to the Busy Bee's Groove
Busy bee makes ya dance, scream and shout
That's what the busy bee is all about
So before I go and before I quit
I'm gonna give you some more of this busy bee hit!

(Verse 4)
Hey ya'll, one day I hit the number and it must be told
I won a million dollars and ten bags of gold
I took a lady shopping as I played the role
Of a rich millionare 22 years old
I called the daily news and then the pope
You shoulda heard me on the phone as I began to boast
Man, the hung up the phone and rushed to the scene
To interview me in that same limousine
She used a six door Caddy with a TV and bar
A space antenna at the back of the car
I toured the streets all through the night
But to hang with busy bee you got to be alright
I said winter spring after that come fall
Any time you're ready just give me a call
We'll talk about the bird and the bees
And the way I rock the house for you young ladies
I was raised in the sun as strong as a ox
Slim, trim, fine as a fox
Right about this time I want ya'll to know I choose the life they call the disco
So get up on your feet, let your fingers pop
Cause busy bee is here and I'm ready to rock
Awh, uh!

(Verse 5)
I rocking new york city all years around
And my name is known all over the town
People here love the way I run my game
And they can't wait to see me make the hall of fame
Busy bee is my name and that's a fact
And you can't beat that with a stick ball bat
Young ladies rock the house
And to all the fly guys rock the house
And you dance and you dance
And don't quit cause the music's designed to be a rock hit

(Bridge)
Just oo ah oh uh ah uh ah

(Verse 6)
I said there's a place, where the Ranch Boys go
You get a little cheeba and get gusto
But in order to you to come in our spot
You got to own three girls, a mansion and a yacht
And then you come inside, and peep a stride
You gotta get cash money to keep the game alive
And then stay on your feet from 9 to 5
Because the boys of the ranch don't take no jive

(Bride)
Ooo ah oh uh ah ah uh ah uhuh ah ah
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

(Verse 7)
Deejays, radio stations all over the nation
Take this record out your cover without hesitation
Cause it's a gift from me, the studio and the sky
When you're on the turntables you'll know why
The B-u-s-y B-e-e the man who rocks the house most definitely
And he flows like a butterfly stings like a bee
He's not the latest but the greatest and they call him Busy Bee
You don't care if I'm the one because all you wanna do is have some fun
So put your hand on your hip i'll make your backbone slip
Put the pedal to the metal, feet with the beat
And get down, stop that messing around
Cause Chief Rocker Busy Bee is in your town
So clap your hands, do the freak dance
Become a victim of circumstance
Cause everybody rocks when Busy Bee is down
Come alive ya'll, c'mon!

(Outro)
Uh ah uh ah uhuh ah uhuh ah ah uhuh ah ah
Busy Bee, Busy Bee, Busy Bee, Busy Bee, Busy Bee
That's right I'm taking em' all out, all bums
