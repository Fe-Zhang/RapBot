[Verse 1: Synester]
I'm a dark skinned brother with long crop
I roll around in a 65 rag top
On triple gold thangs, I used to gang bang, and kick it on the 89 block
I got a whole lotta enemies, sho nuff want to peel me
But that's an everyday thang, can you feel me?
If you was in my shoes, what would you do?
The only thing that I can do is bring the drama to you
So I'll turn up the heat just a tad bit [Tad bit]
Pull out the tech with a reversible clip
And I'll come to yo tip, and lay you out flat
I put the strap up to yo cap and then I'm peelin it back
Just like that!
That's what you get for trying to get wit the killer
100% thug wit no love, that's on the for reala
I will peel ya, wit no remorse, no hesitation
Ya just don't know what ya facin
Fool, I'm smooth but

[Chorus: Synester]
Deadly, Woke up Crazy, G'd up faded
I'm smooth but deadly, Don't know what I feel
Jus got the urge to kill

[Verse 2: Synester]
I be chillin wit the homie d still gizzin big bars
Gettin faded off that ake up at the travel lodge
I know ya think the travel lodge is cheap
But I was raised on the streets, So it's expensive to me
I don't drink Amarett-ah, I drink gordon dines
I don't wear Versace, I wear khaki suits and penal dines
And all my hoes is thugs fa sho
And all my broads be rollin lo lo's
I'm from the deep darkest depths of South central
Home of the body bag, Land of criminals
And people that sell crack, And people that car jack
But I just kick back and let my chips stack
And I'm on my knees sayin lord please [Lord please]
Bless me to make mo cheese [Mo cheese]
Help me up in this industry [This industry]
To succeed and live lavishly
Cause at my do', I have to back track back to thuggish acts
And I'm up in the pelican bay bustin laps wit rats
Strapped wit the k suit steadily ready
Waitin for these fools to test me, G
I'm smooth but

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3: Synester]
I'm a smooth operator with a gangsta twist
I got proper females swangin on my dick
They all wanna take me home so I can hit
But I refuse to break 'em off unless the money is thick
Because I'm picky wit it, They gotta be jus my type
And have an hour glass figure that could last all night
Now they could be dark skinned or light skinned, But able to make me shiver
And when it comes to drama, Gotta be ready to pull the trigger
Smooth and deadly like me, I'm ready to scrap when I'm offended
I won't start drama, But I'll be damned if I don't end it
With the vengeance, You wanna test this? Don't even trip
Cause we can handle it from the shoulders or handle it from the hip
And on the real tip
I don't think you can see me
Because I trunk these thangs man fa sheezy
Ya don't believe me? Ask yo wife
Cause I was runnin up in her last night
Fool, I'm smooth but deadly
On my knees sayin lord please [Lord please]
Bless me to make mo cheese [Mo cheese]
Help me up in this industry [This industry]
Succeed and live lavishly [Lavishly]
All my hoes is thugs fa sho
And all my broads be rollin lo lo's
And strapped wit a k suit steadily ready
Waiting for these fools to test me, G
I'm smooth but

[Chorus til fade]
