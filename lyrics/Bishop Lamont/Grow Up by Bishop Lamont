[Verse 1]
I used to think fuckin' up was cool
Loved ditchin' class 'til I didn't pass high school
My dad always said it's easier to keep up
Than it is to catch up, but all I did was mess up
Roll around the streets, get drunk and shoplift
Freestyle, meanwhile, continue to bullshit
A teenage life, when you think you know everythin'
About everythin' and don't know a damn thing
Hit the 'shaw, liquor, bank, then the gas station
Get to duckin' when they buck in gang altercation
We scatter, then come right back
Shit, riskin' our lives, but never saw it like that
A few blocks down the street, couple fools get capped
Nigga, bullets ain't picky, it coulda been a wrap
It never hits home until your homie get clapped
You at the funeral with tears, sayin' to yourself you gotta grow up

[Hook]
Way up (Up, up)
You not a kid no more, I think it's time to grow
Homie, you better know, you know it's time to grow

Way up (Up, up)
Cause nigga, you too grown, get out and get your own
Your childish ways are gone, I think you better grow up

[Verse 2]
You got a Bentley, but can't keep gas in it
A Gucci wallet, but ain't got cash in it
Go out to eat, it's your treat, then at the last minute
Say you forgot it, never had it, want them to spend it
Now that's an interestin' thang
Cause in your video, you havin' so much blang
A few days ago, I heard you pawned that chain
Instead of coppin' that, you shoulda copped the food chain
V-necks, mohawks, just ain't me
Shit, it barely looked right on Mr. T
Your biker chains, designer shades, just ain't right
Especially when you can't breathe cause your pants's too tight
Wack beats, catchy hooks and little ass kids
Add a dance to it and it's gon' be big
It's our fault everythin' done flip-flopped
You wanna save hip hop, rappers? Then you gotta grow up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga still cruisin' Crenshaw at thirty-six
Your wife at home, you wastin' gas, tryna bust a bitch
At the club, actin' young, wearin' the wrong shit
Think you're Chris Brown, but you look like Keith Sweat, bitch
Ain't you got kids to raise?
Instead of actin' like them, nigga, act your age
Why you wear a wave cap, but ain't got waves
Wear that shit out in public and on church days
And goddamn, niggas, pull up your pants
Got your drawers all out, what you wanna strip dance?
And homeboy, what you doin' in a 5X?
You ain't that big, shit's lookin' like a dress
You bought an iPhone but live in your momma home
Gotta wait 'til she's asleep before you can bone
You grown, you know you wrong
But either way, someday, homeboy, you know you gotta grow up

[Hook]
