[Verse 1: 22Gz]
Fuck you got that black flag on, boy what that G 'bout?
Shoot you in your face motherfucker, I'll flock your teeth out
Gotta keep a blick in my city, I got my heat out
Hop out get to flocking, y'all niggas know what my team 'bout

[Refrain: 22Gz]
Who sixed you in how you turned folk?
You down to spin? Do you twirl, no?
Who- Who- Who sixed you in? How you turned folk?
You down to spin? do you twirl, no?

[Verse 2: 22Gz]
Applying that pressure
Twirling, I'm dripping we spinning
Keep one in the head for the opps
Two more if he get em
Please don't get caught in this world
Or 3 v's, they be bending ya block
Bitch, we go them blicks out
Glizzy with a 30 so the clip stick out
Folks twirl, dripped out
R.I.P. Keke, slap a nigga, Shapow
40. go grtt-pow, you turn, spin round
Reverse, spin round, run and get down

[Refrain: 22Gz]
Who sixed you in? How you turned folk?
You down to spin? Do you twirl? No

[Verse 3: 22Gz]
Grtt-bow, spinnin' ya flat
Etaes, all I was playing with straps
Bitch, I came up, now I'm playing with rats
He tried to run put the k to his back
We toting blickys, we flame em with that
I was just locked up and chasing them shackles
Now we got bands, off the chains, and its rapping
Dont lose your life playing games with this rapper

[Chorus: Casanova]
Punch you in the face, muhfucka', I knock ya teet' out
Every time I come through, nigga, I got my heat out
If you want smoke ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that B 'bout?
Punch you in the face, muhfucka', I knock ya teet' out
Every time I come through, nigga, I got my heat out
If you want smoke ain't nothin' we gotta speak 'bout
See you with that red flag on, what that B 'bout?

[Cassanova]
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood? You ain't even gang
Throw ya hood up, nigga bang
How you tryna rep the hood? You ain't even gang
