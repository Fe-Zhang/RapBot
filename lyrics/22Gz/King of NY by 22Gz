[Intro]
Sniper blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky
Y'all know who run this shit
In the streets and in the industry
Grrrt
Brrat, brrat‚ brrat
Gang‚ gang‚ gang
Right?

[Chorus]
I'm posted up with this chopper and I'm feeling like Pac (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Catch a case, go to court
I'm ridin' 'round with this blick and I'm feeling like Big
I'm the king of New York
Never snitch and never told
Never bitch and never fold (Never that, nigga)‚ yeah
Water whippin' on the stove
Pussy niggas, I'm the G.O.A.T

[Verse 1]
Niggas be pussy, can't handle the pressure (Pussy)
The Smith say y'all niggas be backin' up (That's a fact)
Shootouts in Florida‚ you know the story, bruh
I was locked up in the maximum (Right? Right?)
"Is these niggas killers? Is Blicky the gang?"
Is what these scary niggas be askin' 'em (Gang, gang, gang)
All we care about is spinning, aiming on the victim
Swerving up and blasting 'em (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
When it's war, we comin' nonstop (Right)
Creep on niggas in they blindspot (Where you go?)
Rondo almost caught a triple double (Grrrt)
But we hit his ass with nine shots
Now he layin' in a fuckin' puddle
Dump his body in a pine box (Man down, man down, man down)
Let my dawgs up out they fuckin' muzzle
Guess what happen when we fire opps? (Gang)
Niggas letting down the city vouching for a snitch but I'ma keep it litty
I'm the closest thing to 50, loading up a clip, it's hanging out the blicky (Shout out 50)
I see Q and **** lackin' like some rookies, it ain't gon' be pretty (Don't be lackin')
I see Fetty Luciano, hit him with a hollow, yeah, I keep it with me

[Chorus]
I'm posted up with this chopper and I'm feeling like Pac (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Catch a case, go to court
I'm ridin' 'round with this blick and I'm feeling like Big
I'm the king of New York
Never snitch and never told
Never bitch and never fold (Never that, nigga), yeah
Water whippin' on the stove
Pussy niggas, I'm the G.O.A.T

[Verse 2]
That's a fur once we pullin' up
Mask on and we hoodied up
Been drawn, tryna hit 'em up
Paramedics gon' pick 'em up
Pac and Biggie, got the city
On the East and the West, got a chopper with me
Poppin' blickies, spot 'em, kill 'em
Anybody can get it, they got a problem with it (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
I'm a vet with this TEC, bullets pierce through your neck
We spinning blocks, that's a hobby (Man down, man down)
Out the car, leave a mess
He got caught by the steps
How he end up in the lobby?
Shh when the general speak
Oh, you want beef? (Blicky da blicky)
Don't be a mission complete
We putting rappers to sleep
Sending niggas six feet deep
Sending niggas six feet deep

[Chorus]
I'm posted up with this chopper and I'm feeling like Pac (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Catch a case, go to court
I'm ridin' 'round with this blick and I'm feeling like Big
I'm the king of New York
Never snitch and never told
Never bitch and never fold (Never that, nigga), yeah
Water whippin' on the stove
Pussy niggas, I'm the G.O.A.T
