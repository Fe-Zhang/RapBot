[Hook: 22Gz]
It's a man down if he slip up twirling and sniping with blixky's get stiched up
All of my oppers done linked up, dripping like I did a heist on a Brinks truck
Hot up the spizzy, came with my dizzy, twirling with blixky's, black out the renty
Swerving, spinning, can't wait to cath him
Gang gang gang gang
It's a man down if he slip up twirling and sniping with blixky's get stiched up
All of my oppers done linked up, dripping like I did a heist on a Brinks truck
Hot up the spizzy, came with my dizzy, twirling with blixky's, black out the renty
Swerving, spinning, can't wait to cath him
Gang gang gang gang

[Verse 1: Envy Caine]
Me and folks took a trip to the opp side and we pulled up with 4 blixks kept on spinning and spinning nobody was outside
Took a trip to the Flossy I hopped out and hit nigga Tutu gave me a high five
We ain't leaving no witnesses go check on citizens and police respond like a cop died, hold it down got the drop from a baba
How we caught him was easy, at first I was fiending, I took so long they tried to leave me
Put that boy on a TV, I hope they ain't seen me if Gotti shooting tell him TP
Lil treesh tryna line me, niggas know my body 2 chops I'm moving wocky
Busting of them drugs, smoking too much sour, took a (?) now i'm back on the oxy's
Playing with Coka Jigga you will die

[Verse 2: 22Gz]
Top opp shooting he lost all of his breath, do a drive by out the car then we fled
2V spinning in a Honda or a Wrangler gang gang masked up hunting for revenge
If I call them BB's they all hit your head, my Glock 9 ruger jealous of the tech
On the opps side spinning think that nigga dead, choking, Coka hit him in the neck
42 bitch you could drink up, I got a blixky it'll knock (?) up
All my opps pussy they linked up send yo’ location so we can come link up
He tried to run but he tripped up, that's too bad you a opp you in danger
Strapped drawn it's a stick up ain't gon' ask one more time where the paper
