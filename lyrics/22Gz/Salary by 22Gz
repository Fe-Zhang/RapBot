[Intro]
Sniper blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky
Gang gang gang
Racks racks racks

[Chorus]
Baby, I got so much ice on my pendant, I spent like your salary (Bands, bands)
New blicky get to burning shit up, no, I ain't talking calories
Y’all niggas capping, we strapped up, my shooters pull up, it's a tragedy
Blicky da blicky, all of my niggas is staticky (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Baby, I got so much ice on my pendant, I spent like your salary (Racks, racks)
New blicky get to burning shit up, no, I ain't talking calories
Y’all niggas capping, we strapped up, my shooters pull up, it's a tragedy
Blicky da blicky, all of my niggas is staticky

[Verse 1]
You guys broken batteries
Please don't get turned to a tragedy
Diamonds on me, see the clarity
Ain't got my gun, then I'm stabbin' 'em
All of my niggas move staticky
(Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Bullets get back to reality
I'm making more than your salary (Bands, bands, bands)
Probably the reason they mad at me
Pull up, we burning off calories
Black Suburbans, it’s a casualty
Baby, I got so much ice on my pendant
Changing my ways and the life that I’m living
She fell in love with the way I been dripping
Double cup, lil' bitch, we sipping
I’m headed straight to the top with my niggas
Say the wrong thing, you get dropped for my hitter
And I got aim, highly doubt that he get up
Catching stains, leave you missing (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Chorus]
Baby, I got so much ice on my pendant, I spent like your salary (Bands, bands)
New blicky get to burning shit up, no, I ain't talking calories

Blicky da blicky, all of my niggas is staticky (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Baby, I got so much ice on my pendant, I spent like your salary (Racks, racks)
New blicky get to burning shit up, no, I ain’t talking calories
Y'all niggas capping, we strapped up, my shooters pull up, it's a tragedy

[Verse 2]
They talking shit from the back of me
Can't trust a bitch, I ain't jackin' 'em
Hop out with blicks, we head tappin' 'em
All of my niggas is savages (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Same whip keep on circling (Skrrt skrrt)
Mask on when he lurking it
Strap drawn, yeah, we murkin' 'em
Spinning back, we ain't murder him
Pass me the Runtz, I'ma roll up
None of them niggas ain't usin' they toaster
Bending that block, slow up
Hold up, slow up
Put him in the dirt for a cold cut
I got new guns, I need more butts
We gon' spin again, hit some more of 'em
Don't get picked off tryna roll up
