Tunnel vision to this chicken, stackin' up, I gotta get it

[Verse 2]
Feelin' myself like I'm Diddy, I'm ridin' 'round with my blicky
Henny fuckin' up my liver, we throwin' hundreds on strippers, I got her head on the dishes
Baby let's switch up positions, she wanna fuck 'cause I'm lit, I'm tryna jump in the rift
We ridin' 'round with the blick, youngins slide in the whips, hop out on 'em with a stick
When I'm in the A hit up Lenox
I love the smell of a dead opp
Hit him with it all if he get up
Can't trust these hoes, they a set-up
Totin' that forty Beretta
He get too close, shoot his sweater
Bro said keep goin', don't let up
Pull up, put holes in his dental

[Chorus]
