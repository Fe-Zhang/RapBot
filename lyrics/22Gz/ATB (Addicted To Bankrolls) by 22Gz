[Intro]
Grrrttt!
Pra-Pra-Pra!
Sniper, the blixky, the blixky, the blixky, the blixky
Gang-Gang-Gang
Ra-Ra
Pra-Pra-Pra!
(Live by the gun, die by that shit)
Grrrttt!

[Chorus]
We pull up and hit em and change clothes
They bending through shooting like saints row
Ducking the jakes they in plain clothes
All my niggas took the same oath
Solid nigga I stay ten toes
You know that he oppy don't stand close
I think I'm addicted to bank rolls
Jump in a 'rari take off

We pull up and hit em and change clothes
They bending through shooting like saints row
Ducking the jakes they in plain clothes
All my niggas took the same oath
Solid nigga I stay ten toes
You know that he oppy don't stand close
I think I'm addicted to bank rolls
Jump in a 'rari take off

[Verse 1]
Brand new blixky, tear his face off
Two guns, who wanna face off?
Jump in a 'burban, skate off
The shit that you got ain't yours
Everything I got, paid for
You don't put in work, you laid off
I spin through that block you get rained on
Migos gon' send the work, take off
Break it down with fentanyl
They call me 22 the general
Free my niggas out the federal
Treesh eat me up like a edible
No Uber, kick her out, then I poppin' out
Nigga we around
All the blixkys bring 'em out, drum sticking out
Pull up, air 'em out

[Chorus]
We pull up and hit em and change clothes
They bending through shooting like saints row
Ducking the jakes they in plain clothes
All my niggas took the same oath
Solid nigga I stay ten toes
You know that he oppy don't stand close
I think I'm addicted to bank rolls
Jump in a 'rari take off

We pull up and hit em and change clothes
They bending through shooting like saints row
Ducking the jakes they in plain clothes
All my niggas took the same oath
Solid nigga I stay ten toes
You know that he oppy don't stand close
I think I'm addicted to bank rolls
Jump in a 'rari take off

[Verse 2]
Ain't no politician, fuck the politics
With a baba, she a model bitch
Gang with me, that's a lot of blixks
I was stuck in the jam, but I'm out of it
Case closed, no subpoena
Drippy like Katrina, eater named Sabrina
Sending shots, no tequila
Finger on the trigger
I'm a known sinner (I'm a known killer)
Pull up, hanging out them tinteds
If a nigga slipping, I be there in minutes
Drop the window, heart skipping (Come Here!)
I'll up the chop and I'll lift 'em
Pull up, skrrt off then I'm driftin'
Throw it in sport and get missing
On the stove, in the kitchen
Handling my business
Hit you when I'm finished

[Chorus]
We pull up and hit em and change clothes
They bending through shooting like saints row
Ducking the jakes they in plain clothes
All my niggas took the same oath
Solid nigga I stay ten toes
You know that he oppy don't stand close
I think I'm addicted to bank rolls
Jump in a 'rari take off

We pull up and hit em and change clothes
They bending through shooting like saints row
Ducking the jakes they in plain clothes
All my niggas took the same oath
Solid nigga I stay ten toes
You know that he oppy don't stand close
I think I'm addicted to bank rolls
Jump in a 'rari take off
