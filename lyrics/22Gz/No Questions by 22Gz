Hahahahahaha
Folk
Gang, gang, gang
Y'all niggas know I'm armed and dangerous, nigga, check my rap sheet, nigga
That's what happened to the last nigga that played with me, nigga
And that's word to my mother, nigga
Let me catch one of y'all opp niggas slippin', man
Man down, man down
Folk
Grr (Bah, bah, bah), gang, gang, gang

[Chorus]
Don't test us (Pussy)
Have my youngin take his necklace (Give me that shit)
Got a temper (Come here)
Make a movie like Netflix (Grraow, grraow, grraow)
No effort
I'll leave a nigga breathless (Gang, gang, gang)
Could get reckless (Sniper da Blicky)
Smith & Wesson my preference (Grr)

[Verse 1]
Chattin' (Chattin')
He's talkin' hot on the web until niggas catch him (Pussy)
Lackin' (Come here)
We gon' run down, we ain't gon' clap him, we gon' smack him
We know that you ain't 'bout action (Gang, gang, gang)
All of you niggas is actors (Blicky da Blicky da Blicky)
Gun fingers in the camera (Clappin', cappin', cappin')
They wonder how 22 lastin' (22 lastin')
Run in, they run out the back end (Back end)
Stick that boy up for the backend (Backend)
I heard that that nigga was stackin' (Bands, ransom)
Book a nigga, he ain't sayin' shit (Sayin' shit)
They want the sauce like Plankton (Sauce like)
Jump out the Porsche to a mansion (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Baba treesh mop it off
She don't say nothin', she slide through and pop it
She give me head, Tylenol
Back to the green, money, vamanos
Nigga, we you see you, we tryin' you
Blicky gon' sing like Lionel (Blicky da Blicky)
Gang gang start tweakin' and wildin'
They see an opp nigga and fire

[Chorus]
Don't test us (Pussy)
Have my youngin take his necklace (Give me that shit)

[Verse 2]
Smith & Wesson my preference (My preference)
Chop him up, dissect him (Dissect him)
Kill an opp, send a message, no textin' (Hahahaha)
Pussy better have protection (Where your gun at?)
Pull up and drill out a X6 (Out a X6)
Then exit
Don't think he can get up, he breathless (Don't think he can get up, he breathless)
You talkin' hot, pussy, then pop out (Pop out)
Spin through, everybody got a Glock out (Glock out)
Dead on the spot, they hit his snotbox (Snotbox)
Smoked out the whip like a hotbox (Like a hotbox)
Investin' (Investin')
We coppin' Glocks for the tension (We coppin' Glocks for the tension)
No question
I see an opp, I'ma press it
