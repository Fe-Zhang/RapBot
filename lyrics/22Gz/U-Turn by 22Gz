*Gang with me*
Blixky, Blixky, Blixky, Blixky, Blixky, Blixky
Gang, Gang, Gang!

(Chorus)
Twirling, Swerving, Bending, Lurking
Drifting, Clip 'em, Spinning, U- turning
I got a bitch in my whirlwind
It's a man down close the curtains
Murder, Purging, Kill 'em, Burn 'em

(Verse 1)
Slipping, sipping Apollos
Blixky gon jump out a tahoe
Cute in the face and she fit like a model
Treesh did a split on the bottle
Snatching my soul
Made her slurp on the nozzle
Swerving and drifting them potholes
Bury him, they gon be looking for fossils
Shoot at his neck and his tonsils
Word to my blixky
Been feening to catch him
Glock with a stick
Put some holes in his sweater
Hit it and quit it
She said I'm pathetic
Told that lil treesh to go get it together
Knock a whole chunk out
His liver, his melon
They gon need doctors to piece it together
Toting the 40, the blixky, the tecca
Walk up, drive by, pull up, and wet em

(Chorus)
Twirling, Swerving, Bending, Lurking
Drifting, Clip 'em, Spinning, U- turning
I got a bitch in my whirlwind
It's a man down close the curtains
Murder, Purging, Kill 'em, Burn 'em

(Verse 2)
Put me in the jungle
For sure I'm coming back with a head or two
Put a opp in the sky
That's my definition of him on a pedestal
And my dizzys outside
Down it get into
What you want to get into
I got rid of the gun
It had too much stains
It gotta hella residue
Jacking my drip, had to switch it up
Click clack stick em' up, give em' up
Ain't off a perky, I'm henny'd up
Me and 16, two semi's tucked
Hit you, won't miss you
VVS stones, no crystals
Shout out to Choos on Bristol
We tweaking out going schizo

(Chorus)
Twirling, Swerving, Bending, Lurking
Drifting, Clip 'em, Spinning, U- turning
I got a bitch in my whirlwind
It's a man down close the curtains
Murder, Purging, Kill 'em, Burn 'em
