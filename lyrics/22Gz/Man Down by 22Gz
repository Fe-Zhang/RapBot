[Intro]
Exclusive
Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky

[Chorus]
Chopping windows, sliding doors, it's a man down
Ridin' 'round with a blicky, it's a man down
7-point-62's, that's a missile, get you ran down
Let off the AR or the pistol, get you ran down
Chopping windows, sliding doors, it's a man down
Ridin' 'round with a blicky, it's a man down
7-point-62's, that's a missile, get you ran down
Let off the AR or the pistol, get you ran down (Blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Verse 1]
When we run into you, they gon' have me back on PIX11
I ain't capping, I stay strapped up with a blick or two
I'm tryna finish dude, shot him in his belly and his spinal
With that blicky, then we spinning on his funeral
Ridin' 'round with a MAC-11, what you wanna do?
Tryna finish the job, they chasing him and dumping, boom

[Interlude]
Gang, gang, gang, grrrt
Bah, bah, bah

[Chorus]
Chopping windows, sliding doors, it's a man down
Ridin' 'round with a blicky, it's a man down
7-point-62's, that's a missile, get you ran down
Let off the AR or the pistol, get you ran down
Chopping windows, sliding doors, it's a man down
Ridin' 'round with a blicky, it's a man down
7-point-62's, that's a missile, get you ran down
Let off the AR or the pistol, get you ran down (Blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Verse 2]
I been through a lot, she said I like to screw a lot (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That Beretta, Smith and Wesson, I might use the Glock (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Last nigga caught me slippin' had to shoot it out
Keep the tool a lot, swervin' through like, "Who we got?"
Open fire, ain't no warnings, take his mans out
Find the rod, we gon' see if you playin' 'round
Double and the trip, it just keep hitting at the damn crowd (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
Grrrt, boom, boom, boom

[Chorus]
Chopping windows, sliding doors, it's a man down
Ridin' 'round with a blicky, it's a man down
7-point-62's, that's a missile, get you ran down
Let off the AR or the pistol, get you ran down
Chopping windows, sliding doors, it's a man down
Ridin' 'round with a blicky, it's a man down
7-point-62's, that's a missile, get you ran down
Let off the AR or the pistol, get you ran down (Blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Outro]
Chasin' niggas down, that's all I know
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Grrt, grrt
