[Chorus]
I ain't addicted to this limelight (To this limelight)
Shooter spinning, what it sound like? (What it sound like?)
Opps keep dissing, it don't sound right (Sound right)
I'ma catch that nigga slipping when the time right
I ain't addicted to this limelight (To this limelight)
Shooter spinning, what it sound like? (What it sound like?)
Opps keep dissing, it don't sound right (Sound right)
I'ma catch that nigga slipping when the time right (Time right)

[Verse 1]
Pussy niggas get down, we spin 'round, get picked up
I can fit the ladder in this glizzy, fill the clip up
All we know is man down, get knocked out the picture (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
I need me a ratchet lil' bitch to eat the dick up
She ain't addicted to the limelight (To the limelight)
Niggas tryna steal my soundbite (Steal my soundbite)
We gon' drill him when the time right (Drill him when the time right)
When he finish, what that sound like? (What that sound like?)

[Chorus]
I ain't addicted to this limelight (To this limelight)
Shooter spinning, what it sound like? (What it sound like?)
Opps keep dissing, it don't sound right (Sound right)
I'ma catch that nigga slipping when the time right
I ain't addicted to this limelight (To this limelight)
Shooter spinning, what it sound like? (What it sound like?)
Opps keep dissing, it don't sound right (Sound right)
I'ma catch that nigga slipping when the time right (Time right)

[Verse 2]
Man down, bitch, it's on sight
I was sinning while you niggas was at prom night
Finger itching, hand gripping on a Smith an' (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
We tote blickies, I can't wait to catch him slippin', I'ma spark mine (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
If you offside, my gang let all fly
We got mob ties, catch stains out the ride
Bodies gon' drop, get clapped in your spine
I need all mine, all mine

[Chorus]
I ain't addicted to this limelight (To this limelight)
Shooter spinning, what it sound like? (What it sound like?)
Opps keep dissing, it don't sound right (Sound right)
I'ma catch that nigga slipping when the time right
I ain't addicted to this limelight (To this limelight)
Shooter spinning, what it sound like? (What it sound like?)
Opps keep dissing, it don't sound right (Sound right)
I'ma catch that nigga slipping when the time right (Time right)
