[Intro]
Woo Woo Woo
Da blicky, da blicky, da blicky, da blicky, da blicky
Yeah
Let's get it

[Chorus: 22gz]
Chasing that bag I'm like adios
Give me the grip and I gotta go
Talking no bread then it's vamanos
Your bitch on my heels but she gotta go
They hate cause' we all in our bag now
Focused up, I got a stash now
Her new nigga talk hot
But he sound like the last clown

[Verse 1: Ju Laden]
I run to the beach on the reg
So I got to keep one in the head
All these bitches tryna' play me
So I had to cuff money instead
You know when I step on the scene
I geek and I drip and I lean
The score just went up
Look at my dab when I skrt off the scene
Yeah we the hoe's fave now
Opp niggas show they face now
Boys tryna' book the case now
Young niggas on the chase now
Tell her open up a chase now
Ten bands on the walk through
I'm the man you should talk to
Finesse a bitch if I want to
Finesse a bitch if I want to
Going crazy bitch I'm Goku
Punching heads I'm the go-to
Fucking bitches yeah they old news
Let me get back to these racks
There was days I was sleep in the trap
Touch bread and you know that's a fact
I'm tryna' put gang on the map
We chasing the henny with Act'
Count fetty and watching it stack
Run up get hit with the Mac
Run up get hit with the Mac


[Chorus: 22gz]
Chasing that bag I'm like adios
Give me the grip and I gotta go
Talking no bread then it's vamanos
Your bitch on my heels but she gotta go
They hate cause' we all in our bag now
Focused up, I got a stash now
Her new nigga talk hot
But he sound like the last clown

[Verse 2: 22gz]
Keep a blick and it's one in the head
Rather fill up that bag with some bread
All my niggas know is flip it
If he trip word to mother he dead
With the blickys and we dripping
Done with henny sip muddy instead
For the bag we gon' blitz em'
Just ask Lucas we fucked up a check
Watch how I run to the bag
I geek and I drip now she loving the swag
Been doing shoot-outs in cabs
Run it up and it's still funds in the stash
Swerve and I dip in the Jag
Lou in the back with that drum and a mag
Now let's get back to the cash
Dissing the set put them bands on his ass

[Chorus: 22gz]
Chasing that bag I'm like adios
Give me the grip and I gotta go
Talking no bread then it's vamanos
Your bitch on my heels but she gotta go
They hate cause' we all in our bag now
Focused up, I got a stash now
Her new nigga talk hot
But he sound like the last clown

[Verse 3: Zanotti]
Get to the bag and say adios
My niggas they trap in the car to go
Get to the check and I gotta go
We still FTO got a lot of poles
We taking orders like Dominos
My niggas they trappin' like Pablo
Fuck her we shoot it on camera
Fuck it we shoot at the Bamaz
.40 XD it do damage
We blowing chops and they panic
In the party and we camped up
Fuck the talking get your bands up
Louie with me don't get backed up
Chops with beams and don't get tapped up
We chase a bag on the regular
Niggas won't work to get cheddar up
She heard my track now she wanna fuck
My niggas totin' you better duck
OG he told me to step it up
If that boy run up we wet him up

[Chorus: 22gz]
Chasing that bag I'm like adios
Give me the grip and I gotta go
Talking no bread then it's vamanos
Your bitch on my heels but she gotta go
They hate cause' we all in our bag now
Focused up, I got a stash now
Her new nigga talk hot
But he sound like the last clown
