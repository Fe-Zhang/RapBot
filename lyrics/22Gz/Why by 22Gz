[Chorus]
Why they be movin' like that, why they be shootin' like that?
We pull up, extended clips, hollows, and blickies, go through 'em like that
We spinnin' suburbans and Sprinters, we purge on 'em, do 'em like that
Why you gon' do 'em like that? why you gon' do 'em like that?
Why they be movin' like that, why they be shootin' like that?
We pull up, extended clips, hollows, and blickies, go through 'em like that
We spinnin' suburbans and Sprinters, we purge on 'em, do 'em like that
Why you gon' do 'em like that? why you gon' do 'em like that?

[Verse 1]
Left his brains on the dashboard, why they do him like that?
You turn then reverse and we spinnin', we shootin' like that
Give that boy what he asked for, his medulla might crack
Run up with blickies and siggies for movin' like that
Call Zanotti, he shoot out a cab
Bro got the bin and it's shootin' like that
Spin a block and we spinnin' it back
Hollow tips, blickies go through him like that
Out the window, can't shoot it like that
Walked down on him with a Ruger like that
Fuck a witness, we usin' a mask
All type of glizzies go through him like that

[Chorus]
Why they be movin' like that, why they be shootin' like that?
We pull up, extended clips, hollows, and blickies, go through 'em like that
We spinnin' suburbans and Sprinters, we purge on 'em, do 'em like that
Why you gon' do 'em like that? why you gon' do 'em like that?
Why they be movin' like that, why they be shootin' like that?
We pull up, extended clips, hollows, and blickies, go through 'em like that
We spinnin' suburbans and Sprinters, we purge on 'em, do 'em like that
Why you gon' do 'em like that? why you gon' do 'em like that?

[Verse 2]
Suburbans and Sprinters
Finish it lurkin', we spinnin', that tough talk, get into that
And my boy give, I'm wishin'
Death upon all of my enemies, blickies gon' finish 'em
On my side where they seven
I send that boy up to heaven, his melon we splittin' it
Livin' rich, livin' reckless
Can't show no love in my city, they see through your energy (blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
You a shooter you fidgeting
Fuck is you bluffin' for? pull up, you better dip
Get the drop where my victim is
Caution the yellow tape, I had to finish him
Ain't no love for the opps, he gon' injure them niggas
You claim that's your dog, they gon' spin for you nigga
Get caught out of bounds and we killin' a nigga
Might smoke me an opp or a spliff of a nigga

[Chorus]
Why they be movin' like that, why they be shootin' like that?
We pull up, extended clips, hollows, and blickies, go through 'em like that
We spinnin' suburbans and Sprinters, we purge on 'em, do 'em like that
Why you gon' do 'em like that? why you gon' do 'em like that?
Why they be movin' like that, why they be shootin' like that?
We pull up, extended clips, hollows, and blickies, go through 'em like that
We spinnin' suburbans and Sprinters, we purge on 'em, do 'em like that
Why you gon' do 'em like that? why you gon' do 'em like that?
