[Intro]
Ghosty
Hahaha
Grrrrrrrrr
Twirl, twirl
Folk
Gang-gang-gang

[Chorus]
When we spin through, it's a DOA
We caught a opp at like 3:08
Fuck it and fuck up a POA
I think they mad that I beat the case
I ball in work, I don't need to wait
Catch a man down then I speed away
Gang, gang
Sniper, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky

[Verse 1]
Boy, you at least tryna lean on me
Who got-, can't speak on it
Fat ass butt, I'ma squeeze on it
Better back up before I squeeze on it
We spot him, we on him
Let off some shots, we off this
Slick talk but I had a bing on you
Walk up, drive-by, spin on him
Fuck all the opps, I'ma kill all of 'em
Opp trees, back out, piss on him
Free gang-gang, swear I miss all of 'em
Lock off the whip, make it flip over
She wanna rock, told her bend on me
Buss off the spot, I got ten on me
Count hella guwop, see the bling on it
The drip, I drop, I rain on 'em

[Chorus]
When we spin through, it's a DOA
We caught a opp at like 3:08
Fuck it and fuck up a POA
I think they mad that I beat the case
I ball in work, I don't need to wait
Catch a man down then I speed away
Gang, gang
Sniper, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky
When we spin through, it's a DOA
We caught a opp at like 3:08
Fuck it and fuck up a POA
I think they mad that I beat the case
I ball in work, I don't need to wait
Catch a man down then I speed away
Gang, gang
Sniper, the blicky, the blicky, the blick

[Verse 2]
Perkys bussin', shoot up the function
Aim for his pumpkin, word to my mother
Lock off the junction
This off the top, ain't no punchin'
Shot off my buzzer
Brodie gon' punch him
Folks out, everyone's lurkin'
Where you gon' run to?
Wish a nigga touch me
Sniper Disciples, my shooters gon' come through

[Chorus]
When we spin through, it's a DOA
We caught a opp at like 3:08
Fuck it and fuck up a POA
I think they mad that I beat the case
I ball in work, I don't need to wait
Catch a man down then I speed away
Gang, gang
Sniper, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky
