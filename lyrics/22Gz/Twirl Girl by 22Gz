Ghosty
Twirl-Twirl-Twirl
[Chorus]
That's my little twirl girl, that's my little twirl girl
That's my little twirl girl, you know she loves the blixky
That's my little twirl girl, that's my little twirl girl
That's my little twirl girl, you know she loves the blixky
She gonna spin the block for me, she gonna get the squad for me
She gonna line the opp for me, you know she loves the blixky
She gonna get on top to me, she gonna hold the chop for me
She gonna always ride for me, you knows she loves the blixky

[Verse 1]
Shawty stuck in my whirlwind
But she can't be my girlfriend
Where the fuck is the twirl on
She in love with this twirl shit
Two-seater spinning and swirving it
Said a x a nigga (?) it
New Selena shit and a Birkin
Chanel tote (?) purses
Kick a brush, Blixky right next to the brush
Right to the back
Nigga what's up, she get the dick and it sucks
Hit that boy up
All in the opps, my baby gonna give me the drop
Bulid in a (?) block
Show off the spot
You think you're about to fuck
But no you're about to get shot

[Chorus]
That's my little twirl girl, that's my little twirl girl
That's my little twirl girl, you know she loves the blixky
That's my little twirl girl, that's my little twirl girl
That's my little twirl girl, you know she loves the blixky
She gonna spin the block for me, she gonna get the squad for me
She gonna line the opp for me, you know she loves the blixky
She gonna get on top to me, she gonna hold the chop for me
She gonna always ride for me, you knows she loves the blixky

[Verse 2]
She said the twirl is a (?)
She likes to smoke and get drunk
And she loves to fuck
She do the twirl with her tongue (Oh she's nasty)
I had a one-hitter on a gun
Other hand gripped on her buns
I made her dance on a gun
She do the twirl and the blixky
(?)
You know you the girl for me
Girl you the world to me
Come travel the world with me
Baby come twirl for me
Niggas ever play with you
I'm on a murder spree
That's in a first degree
Shooters don't purge for me

[Chorus]
That's my little twirl girl, that's my little twirl girl
That's my little twirl girl, you know she loves the blixky
That's my little twirl girl, that's my little twirl girl
That's my little twirl girl, you know she loves the blixky
She gonna spin the block for me, she gonna get the squad for me
She gonna line the opp for me, you know she loves the blixky
She gonna get on top to me, she gonna hold the chop for me
She gonna always ride for me, you knows she loves the blixky
