[Intro]
Bah, bah, bah
Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky

[Chorus]
Diamonds wet, they dancing, shining just like chandeliers
We the trending topic, no, you niggas can't compare (Can't compare at all)
RIP my niggas, put them lighters in the air (RIP)
They know how we rocking, get it popping anywhere
Light up the strip like a chandelier
Hella ice on my wrist like a chandelier
A whole lot of Bape drip, this is camo gear
My whole team keep them blickies and ammo, yeah
Light up the strip like a chandelier
Hella ice on my wrist like a chandelier
A whole lot of Bape drip, this is camo gear
My whole team keep them blickies and ammo, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't shoot it, you just carry it
I love guap, yeah, I married it
But a bag on his head, it's lit
To the face, to the head, he sick
How they let me get away with it?
I got dreams counting cake with my niggas
I could never snake on my niggas
Homicide, catch a case for my niggas
We still use .38's for them niggas (Blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Pre-Chorus]
Flexin' on 'em
I remember jumping fences on 'em
Blicky came with some extensions on it
Still some shit that I can't mention, homie (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Chorus]
Diamonds wet, they dancing, shining just like chandeliers
We the trending topic, no, you niggas can't compare (Can't compare at all)
RIP my niggas, put them lighters in the air (RIP)
They know how we rocking, get it popping anywhere
Light up the strip like a chandelier
Hella ice on my wrist like a chandelier
A whole lot of Bape drip, this is camo gear
My whole team keep them blickies and ammo, yeah
Light up the strip like a chandelier
Hella ice on my wrist like a chandelier
A whole lot of Bape drip, this is camo gear
My whole team keep them blickies and ammo, yeah

[Verse 2]
Milly Rock 'em, hella bands, we the trending topic
Counting guap up with the gang like we hit the lotto
I done caught a couple stains, I won't even lie though
Couple niggas in the grave, couple niggas locked up
Wavy, saucy, bitch, I'm wavy, hella bands it cost me
Ain't no love up in these streets, it's only extortions
I ain't ducking from no beef, get put in a coffin
Hop out, walk up, that's the end of story

[Pre-Chorus]
Flexin' on 'em
I remember jumping fences on 'em
Blicky came with some extensions on it
Still some shit that I can't mention, homie (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Chorus]
Diamonds wet, they dancing, shining just like chandeliers
We the trending topic, no, you niggas can't compare (Can't compare at all)
RIP my niggas, put them lighters in the air (RIP)
They know how we rocking, get it popping anywhere
Light up the strip like a chandelier
Hella ice on my wrist like a chandelier
A whole lot of Bape drip, this is camo gear
My whole team keep them blickies and ammo, yeah
Light up the strip like a chandelier
Hella ice on my wrist like a chandelier
A whole lot of Bape drip, this is camo gear
My whole team keep them blickies and ammo, yeah
