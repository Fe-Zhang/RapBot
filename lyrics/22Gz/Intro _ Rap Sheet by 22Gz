[Intro]
Grrrt
Bah, bah, bah, bah

[Chorus]
Get you clapped, we don't play at all
And my rap sheet say it all
It's a murder (Get you murdered)
Pass the gat, I'ma set it off
Out the back, bitch, we letting off
It's a murder (I'm a murderer)
Get you clapped, we don't play at all
And my rap sheet say it all
It's a murder (Get you murdered)
Pass the gat, I'ma set it off
Out the back, bitch, we letting off
It's a murder (I'm a murderer)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm industry, nigga, but in the streets I'm a villian
Got a blick, started spinning and tryna kill opposition
I got homies in graveyards and hitters in prison
Addicted to new guns, cash money, and bitches
Got this strap, I'ma spray it all
He a rat, he gon' tell it all
Lift your shirt up, lay him flat with the semi-auto
Lay him flat, then we layin' low
Get you murdered

[Chorus]
Get you clapped, we don't play at all
And my rap sheet say it all
It's a murder (Get you murdered)
Pass the gat, I'ma set it off
Out the back, bitch, we letting off
It's a murder (I'm a murderer)
Get you clapped, we don't play at all
And my rap sheet say it all
It's a murder (Get you murdered)
Pass the gat, I'ma set it off
Out the back, bitch, we letting off
It's a murder (I'm a murderer)

[Interlude]
Grrrt
Sniper Blickies did it, nigga
Gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang
Grrrt, boom

[Verse 2]
Spin again, open fire, drill on a bitch
U-turn, drop the whip off, did it again
Shoot first, ask later, kill for a living
Quick to take a nigga life, I'm too precise with this blicky
We ain't hitting for no less if you fuckin' with that check
Ain't no need to get undressed, told that ho I need that neck
Catch him slippin', leave a mess, run up on him, y'all be pet
Grrrt, boom

[Chorus]
Get you clapped, we don't play at all
And my rap sheet say it all
It's a murder (Get you murdered)
Pass the gat, I'ma set it off
Out the back, bitch, we letting off
It's a murder (I'm a murderer)
Get you clapped, we don't play at all
And my rap sheet say it all
It's a murder (Get you murdered)
Pass the gat, I'ma set it off
Out the back, bitch, we letting off
It's a murder (I'm a murderer)
