[Intro]
Ghosty
Sniper, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky

[Chorus]
Deep down inside, I know you niggas is scared
You niggas keep dissin' and droppin' tracks
I gave you niggas careers
You should be grateful for me
Say thank you to me 'cause we shootin' for heads
We left him slumped in the whip
Toe tag, they pronouncin' him dead
Deep down inside, I know you niggas is scared
You niggas keep dissin' and droppin' tracks
I gave you niggas careers
You should be grateful for me
Say thank you to me 'cause we shootin' for heads
We left him slumped in the whip
Toe tag, they pronouncin' him dead

[Verse 1]
If it wasn't on 22Gz
Nigga, who would you diss?
I 'on't even know you niggas
You don't even spend
Hop out with snipers and blickys
Got flacos and trawlers
Parked up where you live
Niggas be sayin' it's lit
But really that ain't what it is
Pop out, that's a stain on the blick
I ain't heard your name in the mix
These niggas be playin' the snitch?
Matchin' the stains they ain't get it
I ain't emptied his name on a clip
'Cause he tried to play with a blick
I'm puttin his name on cement
Whatever I'm sayin' I meant

[Chorus]
Deep down inside, I know you niggas is scared
You niggas keep dissin' and droppin' tracks
I gave you niggas careers
You should be grateful for me
Say thank you to me 'cause we shootin' for heads
We left him slumped in the whip
Toe tag, they pronouncin' him dead
Deep down inside, I know you niggas is scared
You niggas keep dissin' and droppin' tracks
I gave you niggas careers
You should be grateful for me
Say thank you to me 'cause we shootin' for heads
We left him slumped in the whip
Toe tag, they pronouncin' him dead

[Verse 2]
I know these niggas my fans
Copy my back, my stance
Stealin' my drip, my swag
Might as well call me they dad
'Cause I done fathered your flow
Took it from me and we already know
Niggas done copied my dance
Added they moves and made it they own
Niggas is duplicants
But they ain't the real thing, they ain't shootin' shit
What's on your rap sheet?
Charges don't tell me that you really clap heat
Catch you in the back street
Passenger side, sun roof or the back seat
You niggas ain't active
You don't make the movies, you niggas is actors

[Chorus]
Deep down inside, I know you niggas is scared
You niggas keep dissin' and droppin' tracks
I gave you niggas careers
You should be grateful for me
Say thank you to me 'cause we shootin' for heads
We left him slumped in the whip
Toe tag, they pronouncin' him dead
Deep down inside, I know you niggas is scared
You niggas keep dissin' and droppin' tracks
I gave you niggas careers
You should be grateful for me
Say thank you to me 'cause we shootin' for heads
We left him slumped in the whip
Toe tag, they pronouncin' him dead

[Outro]
Bap-bap-bap
Suck my dick
Grrrrrrrr
Gang-gang-gang
Sniper, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky
