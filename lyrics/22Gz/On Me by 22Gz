[Chorus]
She my little hitter for sure, she riding with a nigga
If I got a bid, she do the time with a nigga
Blow a bag on you, baby, don't waste your time with them niggas
If I got it, you got it, baby, you my lil' hitter
You know that I got it on me
You know that I got it on me
So don't run up on me
Yeah, I keep it on me
You know that I got it on me
So don't run up on me

[Verse 1]
She gon' hold me down, I'm fighting charges
She my lil' hitter, yeah, that's for surely
If I got it, you got it, we balling
Blow a bag on you, baby, fuck what it cost me
Yeah, I got it on me 'cause they plotting on me
Coppers locked me up, she had laid down for surely
Both gettin' money, fill that bag with hundreds
I'm the one she wanted, miss me with the nonsense

[Chorus]
She my little hitter for sure, she riding with a nigga
If I got a bid, she do the time with a nigga
Blow a bag on you, baby, don't waste your time with them niggas
If I got it, you got it, baby, you my lil' hitter
You know that I got it on me
You know that I got it on me
So don't run up on me
Yeah, I keep it on me
You know that I got it on me

[Verse 2]
Held it down, yeah, that's my lil' hitter
Spend some time, I'm tryna build with you
Told her want that shit a lil' quicker
Ain't my dawg, ain't play the field with you
These bitches get around, I'm quick to dick 'em down
Send splits and bend it down, she spit, then spin around
These bitches get around, I'm quick to dick 'em down
Send splits and bend it down, she spit, then spin around
Oh, oh, for sure, for sure, for sure
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
She my little hitter for sure, she riding with a nigga
If I got a bid, she do the time with a nigga
Blow a bag on you, baby, don't waste your time with them niggas
If I got it, you got it, baby, you my lil' hitter
You know that I got it on me
You know that I got it on me
So don't run up on me
Yeah, I keep it on me
You know that I got it on me
