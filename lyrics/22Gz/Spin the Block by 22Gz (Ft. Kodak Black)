[Intro: 22Gz]
Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat (Laundromat)
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back (Never)
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that (Yeah, yeah)
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
If I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop

[Verse 1: 22Gz]
Get the chips, gotta get the guap (Racks, racks, racks)
Word to mother, we tote blicks, I got hella opps
Headshot, face shot, if them rakes is dropped
ABC and PIX11, yellow tape the block
That pussy, I'ma punish that
Them blickys, I'm in love with that
Tuck it like a running back, we throwin' like some quarterbacks
Choppers like a lumberjack, hell nah, I ain't with none of that
Say some shit, they run with that, got Dracos with the drum attached
Take a spin, let's go kill an opp (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Hollow tips eat up his liver, they know how we pop
It ain't safe, yeah, we spin a lot
Broad day, head tap, I done killed a lot

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat (Laundromat)
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back (Never)
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that (Yeah, yeah)
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
If I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I don't know about them, I don't know about y'all, but I'ma keep a Glock
Don't play with me, I swear 'fore God I'll get a nigga shot
And I can't let you hold the rod, I don't know what you 'bout
See, I be runnin' with the squad 'cause we all we got
Me and 22Gz hit your scene, sprayin' .223's
I'm just tryna beat, when I skeet, baby, you can leave
I can't even see, all this blood in my eyes
Let me in the club with my gun, that's my ID
Damn, how the fuck I'm in a Jag' and I'm sniping? Yeah
Hit your block with no tag and no high beams
Sniper Gang, boy, you know who got your nigga popped
Broad day, don't check, I done killed a lot

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat (Laundromat)
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back (Never)
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that (Yeah, yeah)
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
If I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop

[Verse 3: 22Gz]
If he act up, we gon' spin his block, make it hot (Make it hot)
Everything litty, Henny in the spot (In the spizzy), I got knots
Got the gang with me, they know how we rockin' (Gang, gang, gang)
I got aim with it, blickys get to poppin'
I keep one up in the head, run up on him, he ain't dead
Valentinos, a few racks, oh yeah, y'all ain't did that yet (Racks, racks, racks)
I love runnin' up these bands, gettin' money, need that cheddar (Bands, bands, bands)
I got Flatbush on my back, FTO, don't get caught slippin'
Early mornin' and we fishin', I'm tryna catch a victim
Switch the plates up on the Civic, we purging, tryna kill him
Beat my charges, now it's litty
Gang gang, they comin' with me (Gang, gang, gang)
The gang, they comin' with me

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat (Laundromat)
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back (Never)
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that (Yeah, yeah)
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
If I miss, I'ma spin the block (Spin the block)
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop
