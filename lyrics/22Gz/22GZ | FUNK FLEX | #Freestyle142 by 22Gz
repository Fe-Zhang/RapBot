[Verse 1: 22Gz]
Love spinning
All I care about is blood dripping
Never let it slide, [?] until he die, me and mine hold a grudge different
I can see that he ain't man enough
And we can tell that he ain't gang enough
Throwing bullets like the Patriots
But what I'm airing let him hang it up
Slide up on 'em with a long blick
Like John Wick made his car flip
Who the leader of this drill shit?
Really slide through, Vietnam shit
Gang, gang, gang
Yeah I dripping Versace
These Treeshas, they all on my body
Bet he gon' run for his life when he see what I stuff in a shotty
Big facts
Know they wonder how I did that
They gon' be asking 'em "Who shot ya?"
I got 'em feeling like Big's back
Ay, big straps
Hurt my shoulder with the kick back
Say my name and it's gon' be a war
Pull up, a hole's in his six pack

[Verse 1 Outro: 22Gz]
Gang, gang, gang

Spin through the floor c

Treeshas, bye bye

Backout I ain't Tryna end up on Morey
Too dripped out
Black rain when the gang flip out
Clips stick out
Reload once this shit slip out
The blicky, the blicky, the blicky, the blicky
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Uh, 22 the nigga they rap 'bout
They ain't the same when his strap out
If you ain't know you should check on my background
If you ain't dead they spin back round
Met a lil Treesha she's tryna get slapped out
Ended up blowing her back out
Fuck her on the balcony, I made her tap out
Gang, gang
When we pinned up
Keep that blick tucked
If he trip up
He won't get up
Rest in piss to that boy that got hit with a hollow now he in gelato
And still free the twirlers, I'm screaming free Kodak, I'm screaming free Rollo
Feel like Tony Montana want you to get left your a steppa like Mono
With a Treesha, Milano

Clapping like standing ovation
