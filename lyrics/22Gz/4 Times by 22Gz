[Chorus]
Only blue hunnids I'm thumbing (Bands bands)
I'm been on my grind, on my come up (Racks)
Hit them 4 times like Stunna (4 times)
YSL drip like Gunna (Drip drip drip)
Y'all ain't even getting no money
And I'm paid like the first of the month
Shoot it out ain't no running (Bap bap)
If it's static you know that we coming
Only blue hunnids I'm thumbing (Bands bands)
I'm been on my grind on my come up (Racks)
Hit them 4 times like Stunna (4 times)
YSL drip like Gunna (Drip drip drip)
Y'all ain't even getting no money
And I'm paid like the first of the month
Shoot it out ain't no running (Bap bap)
If it's static you know that we coming

[Verse 1]
You niggas big cap no front (No front)
You really ain't got no funds (No fun)
They aimin' their heads in the camera (Camera)
They really ain't got no guns (No guns)
These niggas ain't got no names
These niggas ain't got no stains (Haha)
Nigga get kicked out of the whip
Now the nigga not gang gang (Gang gang gang)
I heard he was Jacking the set
Suddenly the nigga jus changed (Change change change)
Niggas do a little bit of time come home
Now they not the same gang (Same gang)
That be the Floss shit
Shit get me sick, that make me nauseous (Nauseous)
Better move cautious (Cautious)
Them hollows connect and they hitting your off switch

[Chorus]
Only blue hunnids I'm thumbing (Bands bands)
I'm been on my grind, on my come up (Racks)
Hit them 4 times like Stunna (4 times)
YSL drip like Gunna (Drip drip drip)
Y'all even getting no money
And I'm paid like the first of the month
Shoot it out ain't no running (Bap bap)
If it's static you know that we coming
Only blue hunnids I'm thumbing (Bands bands)
I'm been on my grind, on my come up (Racks)
Hit them 4 times like Stunna (4 times)
YSL drip like Gunna (Drip drip drip)
Y'all ain't even getting no money
And I'm paid like the first of the month
Shoot it out ain't no running (Bap bap)
If it's static you know that we coming

[Verse 2]
Dripping like Gunna, hundreds I'm thumbing
Chanel, Balenciaga, Gucci running (Drip drip)
Bitch I'm a stunner, ain't tryna cuddle
Ice around my neck, I flew straight out the gutta
Two blicks and they both nines
See a opp and it's go time
Pull up on him, hit him 4 times
This pussy ain't committing no crimes (Skrt skrt skrt)
Wavy like Ruffles, no time to scuffle
Popping these tags, jumping out and dumping
Hit after hit, going dumber and dumber
Chick after chick, had one hell of a summer
[?] hoes on a spine, always going to go in his time
You lucky it was a short time, he ain't dead so [?] times

[Chorus]
Only blue hunnids I'm thumbing (Bands bands)
I'm been on my grind, on my come up (Racks)
Hit them 4 times like Stunna (4 times)
YSL drip like Gunna (Drip drip drip)
Y'all ain't even getting no money
And I'm paid like the first of the month
Shoot it out ain't no running (Bap bap)
If it's static you know that we coming
Only blue hunnids I'm thumbing (Bands bands)
I'm been on my grind, on my come up (Racks)
Hit them 4 times like Stunna (4 times)
YSL drip like Gunna (Drip drip drip)
Y'all ain't even getting no money
And I'm paid like the first of the month
Shoot it out ain't no running (Bap bap)
If it's static you know that we coming
