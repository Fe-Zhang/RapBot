You know, they say God gave us the toughest battle to make us a strong soldier
*G-ghosty*

[Hook]
I made a pledge
I took a oath
My word is honor
I made a promise
If I'm on a drill *G-ghosty*
Then we moving tact
We catching a opp
If I'm on a drill
Somebody get shot
Them bodies gon drop
I made a pledge

I took a oath
My word is honor
I made a promise
If I'm on a drill
Then we moving tact
We catching a opp
If I'm on a drill
Somebody get shot
Them bodies gon drop

[Verse 1]
A body gon fall down
Reload, spin back
Make sure that they all down
Shoot out the car
Or I'm in your hood blixk down during walk downs
Youngest in charge
You don't wanna see young niggas with them torches
The general blixky
They look at me and they see what a boss is
If I pull the plug
Lights out in my city
Gang, gang gon off shit
Nothing but corpses
We ready for war
We ain't taking no losses
I got the strategy
Blixky the family
We always staticky
Charge up ya battery
Got a album of opps
Don't get put in a gallery
They know I-I'm like that
The hoes know I'm shiggy
I know that they like that
He talking tough?
The blixky with me
I ain't gotta be right back
Where you get your stripes at?
Catch ya big homie
And give them a nightcap
Roll him and light that
Spliff a nigga cause I know he ain't like that
Mauley ain't put in no dub
Get kicked out of the whip
Now he a dub
He still could get hit with a slug
Don't care what he is
Never cared what he was
Friends turn enemies
Niggas be mad
It be the jealousy
Go catch you a felony
You looking bad they tarnished your legacy

[Hook]
I made a pledge
I took a oath
My word is honor
I made a promise
If I'm on a drill *G-ghosty*
Then we moving tact
We catching a opp
If I'm on a drill
Somebody get shot
Them bodies gon drop

I made a pledge
I took a oath
My word is honor
I made a promise
If I'm on a drill
Then we moving tact
We catching a opp
If I'm on a drill
Somebody get shot
Them bodies gon drop

[Verse 2]
Body for body
Who shot em? We shot em
Spot em, red dot em
Man down, it's a homi
Come through your block and we clean it
Slumped in a foreign, he leaning
Drop a blue face and they bleed it
Nigga, just give me a reason
Loose screws cause we tweaking
Gang, gang get to squeezing
I took a oath
Develop and grow
That's word to the folks
And I made a pledge that he gon be dead
Shots to the head
I wish the oppers would stop all the dissing bout niggas that's dead
And pull up instead
Pussy pull up instead

[Hook]
I made a pledge
I took a oath
My word is honor
I made a promise
If I'm on a drill *G-ghosty*
Then we moving tact
We catching a opp
If I'm on a drill
Somebody get shot
Them bodies gon drop

I made a pledge
I took a oath
My word is honor
I made a promise
If I'm on a drill
Then we moving tact
We catching a opp
If I'm on a drill
Somebody get shot
Them bodies gon drop

[Outro]
Don't judge me though
