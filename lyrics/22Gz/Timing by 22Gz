[Chorus]
I'm on timing (I'm on timing), I'm on timing (I'm on timing)
I need money, I need guap, I love grinding (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
I just flooded out my watch with these diamonds (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I just spent like two-two G's on these diamonds (On these diamonds)
I'm on timing (I'm on timing), I'm on timing (I'm on timing)
I need money, I need guap, I love grinding (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
I just flooded out my watch with these diamonds (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I just spent like two-two G's on these diamonds (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Verse 1]
You ain't never kill an opp, what's your timing?
I just flooded out my pendant with these diamonds (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
And my pockets full of knots when I'm sliding (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
ABC and PIX11 said a Honda
They ain't riding, commit some violence
Semi-automatic or the shotty
I be shining, money piling (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
Pesos and dineros, I need a lot of it (Racks, racks, racks, racks)

[Chorus]
I'm on timing (I'm on timing), I'm on timing (I'm on timing)
I need money, I need guap, I love grinding (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
I just flooded out my watch with these diamonds (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I just spent like two-two G's on these diamonds (On these diamonds)
I'm on timing (I'm on timing), I'm on timing (I'm on timing)
I need money, I need guap, I love grinding (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
I just flooded out my watch with these diamonds (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I just spent like two-two G's on these diamonds (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)

[Verse 2]
I just spent like two-two G's on my neck and my watch
Told that bitch get on her knees, want the neck, keep your twat
Shooters hanging out the vehicle, they aiming for top
In the middle of the winter, bitch, we making it hot
I done ran up some bands, bitch, I'm the man (Racks, racks, racks, bands)
Blicky came with extensions, that nigga ran
Baby girl, what's your plans, you got a man?
Spent that case in the yams, gang

[Chorus]
I'm on timing (I'm on timing), I'm on timing (I'm on timing)
I need money, I need guap, I love grinding (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
I just flooded out my watch with these diamonds (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I just spent like two-two G's on these diamonds (On these diamonds)
I'm on timing (I'm on timing), I'm on timing (I'm on timing)
I need money, I need guap, I love grinding (Bands, bands, bands, bands)
I just flooded out my watch with these diamonds (Racks, racks, racks, racks)
I just spent like two-two G's on these diamonds (Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky)
