[Intro]
Dzy on the beat
Bands, bands
Blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky da blicky
Gang, gang, gang
Grrrt

[Chorus]
Crime rate, tryna bring it up, unload them choppers
Pockets filled up with the Benjamins, they plottin'
Guapped up, hella fettuccini, fuck the nonsense
Opp nigga thought he caught me slipping, had to pop him
Crime rate, tryna bring it up, unload them choppers
Pockets filled up with the Benjamins, they plottin'
Guapped up, hella fettuccini, fuck the nonsense
Opp nigga thought he caught me slipping, had to pop him

[Verse 1]
Opp niggas never on nothing, I'm with the drama
Catch a nigga lackin', up the llama, drop him
I been stacking all this fettuccini, got my guap up
Niggas think it's sweet 'til a real nigga pop up
Split a nigga noodle, now his brains look like lobsters
I got a Suburban full of shooters tryna pop somethin'
Pockets filled, Glock is near
Bitches freakin', tryna top the kid
She a thotty bitch, caught the top and slid

[Chorus]
Crime rate, tryna bring it up, unload them choppers
Pockets filled up with the Benjamins, they plottin'
Guapped up, hella fettuccini, fuck the nonsense
Opp nigga thought he caught me slipping, had to pop him
Crime rate, tryna bring it up, unload them choppers
Pockets filled up with the Benjamins, they plottin'
Guapped up, hella fettuccini, fuck the nonsense
Opp nigga thought he caught me slipping, had to pop him

[Verse 2]
Let off, then we drippin', my energy been different
Thought he caught me slippin', got four more in my Smith an'
Pull up with that wand, poof, that nigga missin'
That .40 and that nine look like two bitches kissing
Snipe him with a blicky, left him snoozed, he a victim
Niggas running Rickey out they shoes, he was sprinting
If they askin', we did it
Y'all some YouTube killers
Say the streets a jungle
I'm with two gorillas (Gang, gang, gang)

[Chorus]
Crime rate, tryna bring it up, unload them choppers
Pockets filled up with the Benjamins, they plottin'
Guapped up, hella fettuccini, fuck the nonsense
Opp nigga thought he caught me slipping, had to pop him
Crime rate, tryna bring it up, unload them choppers
Pockets filled up with the Benjamins, they plottin'
Guapped up, hella fettuccini, fuck the nonsense
Opp nigga thought he caught me slipping, had to pop him
