[Hook]
Pop out, hop out
Chop out, watch out
Catch me a- knock out
I made his bitch, tap out
Walk in the party, no pat down
Henny, patron til i pass out
Pop out, hop out
Chop out, watch out

[Verse 1]
Hope it don't escalate
'hang out the 'burban or escalade
Boosting my accolades
24/7 we purgin' for hella days
Lingo chatting trapanese
Spinning, twirling, bending rapidly
He got a back full of batteries
But that boy snitched on assault and battery
We tryna burn off some calories
Ain't with the chattery, cause a fatality
Chop 'em up to slices
Hollow tips rip biceps
Move real tact like ISIS
Got hands like Mike Tyson
I'm with blixks and snipers
We spin blocks, they typing

[Hook]
Pop out, hop out
Chop out, watch out
Catch me a- knock out
I made his bitch, tap out
Walk in the party, no pat down
Henny, patron til i pass out
Pop out, hop out
Chop out, watch out

[Verse 2]
Knocks out, block out
Flock out, mop out
I see a opp, let me hop out
We getting shiggy as soon as she clock out
My house, pulling my cock out
One in the head and I'm aiming for mattas, mattas
You better watch out
Hit from the back, I can't wife on a baba
They sick
Ain't dead? They spin
Reverse that whip
We twirl with blixks
Got sauce, got drip
Get wacked, don't slip
Swerve, drift
U-turn, it's clipped

[Hook]
Pop out, hop out
Chop out, watch out
Catch me a- knock out
I made his bitch, tap out
Walk in the party, no pat down
Henny, patron til i pass out
Pop out, hop out
Chop out, watch out
