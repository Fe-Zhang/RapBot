[Feist - Intuition Sample]
And it came a heat wave
A merciful save
You choose you chose
Poetry over prose
A map is more unreal than where you've been
Or how you feel
A map is more unreal than where you've been
Or how you feel
And it's impossible to tell
How important someone was
And what you might have missed out on
And how he might have changed it all
And how you might have changed it all for him
And how he might have changed it all
And how you might have changed it all for him
Did I (6x)
And it's impossible to how important something was and what you might have missed out on & how it might...
(It could've been everything but then again it could've meant nothing)(4x)

[Verse 1]
It could've meant everything, but then again it could've meant nothing
It could've been something I made in my mind
Could've been just a waste of my time but
I guess ill never know now
Well I guess I better go now
Half drunk on the high way
I guess I better slow down
Best that I don't go around there again
Or think back to the where & when, collapse in the air is thin
Im basking and berried in shades of grey
Or was it all a dream that'll fade away
I move to another chapter and page today
The first time in a while that I prayed today

[Verse 2]
Wish I could see the future sometimes
Wish I could see the truth and lies
Wish I could be a use more than just the music and rhymes
Wish people would remove their disguise but who am I but another human
Shot full of flaws and regrets trying to cash in all of my bets
The laughter, the cries
The hellos and sad goodbyes
One-side struggles, the others capitalized
Half was dying inside trying to maintain
The other half is going crazy trying to stay sane
We play games never knowing the outcome
Wish I knew the answer im without one

[Verse 3]
What if I didn't stay at it?
What if I gave it up and they grabbed it
What if I didn't spare it all?
What if I was selfish and didn't share it all
What if I was scared and didn't dare to call
What if I was weightless And didn't care to fall
What if I didn't make it to tomorrow would people even care I was gone
But there is the dawn and there is the fresh air as I yawn
I hear them voices from here and beyond they tell me dear be strong
Let go of the fear be gone put everything you feel in your songs were here cheering you on
