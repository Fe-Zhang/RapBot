Intro:

Welcome..
Respect is shown..
I welcome y'all as a guest in my home
Where I create
Where I rest my ?
Diz Gibran man...
My nigga Moonshine

Verse 1:

From my mouth to God's ears
Endured some hard years of living
Any advice I'm all ears
I do it for people looking for lives to call theirs
Just trying to find a way to recline like lime shares
Is Diz Gibran dead ? like I'm walking on air
With a robe overgrown beard and long hair
Beyond rare I'm good money so buddy
No need to count it it's all there
Hardware for the text savvy and gladly
I'll upgrade it maintain it and update it
I'm above greatness so much that I love haters
For keeping up with what I've done latest
Lifestyles of the young and famous
Take a dander at the one who made it
With other candor I communicate it
I do it basic no strings associated
No weaklings in the chain my team is motivated
Don't debate it it's a no win, no pen
Can match what we're capable of
Conceive that either that or nigga take it in blood
So ease back believe it's poltergeist on the mic
He's back, I leave slack for the late comers
Already got too many cats on my dick take a number
Eighth wonder in place with great wonder
Any top seat runner I'm paced to take under
Take cover nigga run for the hills
Ain't another coming krill like the brother Khalil
And still number one if I never make another joint
Play your position man just make sure I run the point
