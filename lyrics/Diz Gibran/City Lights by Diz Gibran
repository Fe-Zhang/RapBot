[Hook]
Locked up inside my metal cage
Always tense and filled with rage
Above the concrete fields below
With you I wanna go, wanna go
Emotionless this city lies
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
Shades on my day
I live inside this play

[Verse 1]
In the city where the misery’s abundant
Where the pity find sympathy amongst em
And the well-off, feel no empathy
Where the foul move and get no penalty
No remedy or vaccine to numb it out
We cut deep, no back team can flush﻿ it out
So we run about lost where the streets have no names
Cross paths, and when we meet it’s flammable like propane
This is where the most is not adequant
Where you only﻿ go as far as your imagine it
Where the road is longer where your travelling
And whutchu given up you’ll never get back again
Trapped within the lights of the city
Where it looks full of life but inside it’s all empty
And from outside it’s all tempting
What, it’s all lies upon entry

[Hook]
Emotionless this city lies
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
Shades on my day
I live inside this play

[Verse 2]
In the city where it’s overdone
Where every word is like a loaded gun
Where people take and always owe you one
Where we get over, but never overcome
With those that live in the cold is shunned
With folks get exposed, souls is sold for crumbs
Where niggas wanna know where you from
No matter where you go to, there’s nowhere to run
Be prepared for the bumps and bruises
A man becomes whatever he chooses
The land that never hunger for loose clips
And fans are never above of who’s big
The rules are not written
But better play em right, nigga, you are not exempted
You are not﻿ different
You disposable you are not depended on

[Hook]
Emotionless this city lies
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
Shades on my day
I live inside this play

[Verse 3]
Lost angel, searchin’ for paradise
But wind up melting their wings from high farenheits
Can’t see their way, blinded by the glaring lights
Keep fallin until they finally get scared of heights
Keep stallin till they finally get scared of life
And fall victim to the snakes and parasites
Lose all they spirit and can’t bare to fight
Swear I can hear it comin' in the air tonight

[Hook]
Locked up inside my metal cage
Always tense and filled with rage
Above the concrete fields below
With you I wanna go, wanna go
Emotionless this city lies
Cruel it is, it clouds my eyes
Shades on my day
I live inside this play
