[Orange Chorus: Desdamona]
My favorite color is orange cause I like what he do to me
My favorite lover is orange cause he tastes so sweet
My favorite flavor is orange, he's my favorite treet
My favorite brother is orange cause he likes my peach

[Desdamona]
First time I saw him, I was wrapped in my own words
He came close to me, said he knew I was no regular girl
He could see I was intrigued he used his words to entice me
It was easy to capture me with all the senses he confided in me

[Orange Chorus]

{*instrumental breakdown*}

[Desdamona]
Like a storm in the night, he came in wet, before I could open my eyes
He showed me everything and then he ran to hide
Wasn't long that orange he started to lose his tangerine hues
His brightness how it turned so quick, now I'm in love with blue

[Blue Chorus: Desdamona]
My favorite color is blue cause I like what he do to me
My favorite lover is blue, midnight between my sheets
My favorite flavor is blue, he's my blueberry treet
My favorite brother is blues cause he likes my... OOOH

[Desdamona: repeat 6X]
He likes my... OOOH

[Desdamona: repeat 12X]
Blue, is the one for me

[Desdamona]
Blue.. blue.. blue.. blue..
