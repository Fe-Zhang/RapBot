(feat. Azeem)
ITC I race to take charge
Everybody is talking about shining about superstar shine
First time I .. it was like
Had an earthquake in the moon walk and the cloud spinning
Sunlight froze the sky starts to swimming
My head god heavy, my body turn to prison to broke
I feel freedom for the first time I was awoke
Every language creates the spoke unknown
Learn to turn concrete in the hole be hold
Words worth more than diamonds and …
You know who I am?
…I go the time like a .. while is cold outside
The ..the end of the age is good time and I’ma say is right
Black lions …
The crime who woke the giant .. turn the radio silence
…vampire, the .. is high
They say they saw the ..
...baby shine right in the …
I can’t express new song…
The ..is gold life be amazing
They be like Jay Z ..
Everything is what it is, there’s nothing to fear
The statistics in my occupation …actually happen to live off that shit
… they ain’t really crackin’ for 99,9%...
..for young fashion, flax and style the essence of tradition
Sounds ..in six seconds, make your shit sound like the microphone ..
F*ck of be good or bad of it ..if you’re scared of the ..
Be aware, we’re in the devil’s .. I take a stare ..

Chorus:
…hold in my hands .., I’m darkness I come from night ..
Whatever ..shining …
Shut up ..for a show last night
Back stage these girls like: are you ..? hell yeah
We’re in town one night, she wanna spend it with me
Yes I’m tricky all right ..it’s cool mammy, I’ma join your vibe and you’ll find
… it’s been a ride, maybe another time..i f*ck, I’m lie
I put it to the .., I put it in the .. i find .. heads off on my performance
Cleaning up doesn’t get you more famous …doesn’t make a shit ..
Sound ..malicious, can’t cool .. the fire ..down
