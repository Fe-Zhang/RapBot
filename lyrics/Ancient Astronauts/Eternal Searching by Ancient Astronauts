Eternal search, what is worth, I’ve been feeling it ever since birth
The cosmic echoe ..being from the dirt, dust in, dust and .. in a shirt
Money in a pocket, radio alert, .. the universe is staring
Got a perfect idea, perfect carry, on a mission to gather all so darin’
Eternal searching, so researching, on a road ready to go any person
What my version ain’t that easy to average person though wanna ..
Got me microscope but still can’t see me in the gates of .. my name is ..
Eternally beyond life is a hell I’m a human being got a ..

Chorus:
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
When the journey ends will you have friends
Will you have friends or they hold up your end
Hold up your end, will eternally searching, come on get in
Classic case of living beyond me, all in the name of the American dream
Now it seems the bottom is falling, life it’s about …
My number can’t fall it, but I ignore it, ‘cause I like to chase it before I explore it
Ladies adore it, haters they like it, most of my lyrics makes the things that I’m psychic
Electromagnetic, so genetic, I get it from my .., what you expect kid
Ancient … if you can’t see it, you’d better respect it
Not to sound reckless I believe in .. so your head .. possess this freshness
My breath .. larger with the life, for every breath you breathe, I breathe twice
‘cause I’m quite a nice, back to the humble I won’t be ..
I don’t even mumble loud and clear, here comes some .. in your ear
I stare that .. for all our soldiers, who search in with .. that I hold you

Chorus:
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
Eternal searching with no rehearsing
When the journey ends will you have friends
Will you have friends or they hold up your end
Hold up your end, will eternally searching, come on get in
