Kill these rap niggas with no regard/ they dress cool but don't got bars/ kidnap whoever A&R'd push they wig back with that AR/ death to all of that wack shyt/ niggas talking down I won't have it/ I make all the models get ratchet/ hit the scene ya broad gone that's magic/ y'all failing off and that's tragic/ tryna concertante on these classics/ all in my songs you hear passion/ exactly what these niggas is lacking/ no co sign or no backing/ still got the venue cracking/  no sag card I'm not acting/ even when the cameras off we bout action/ (let's get it) to be all G these niggas PC cuz they definitely ain't Mac'n/ talk bricks all in that stash box but certainly ain't trapping/ they think the lane there's They ain't playing fair to I catch em off up in traffic/ run on em off the road the king overthrown/b4 ya realize what happen whoa!

Hook: one I'm ah get it, they say the sky the limit, but I'm shooting for the stars/ cuz the sky I'm living in it/ last night I had a vision that I was gonna be rich/ today I woke up rich ain't that bitch?/ I just get this Guwop and stack it, I just get this Guwop and stack it, I just get this Guwop and stack it, ain't no leasing on that phantom, I just get this Guwop and stack it ain't no leasing on that phantom nigga...


2nd verse {Chuck inglish of The Cool Kids}

Nauti champ calling in a Audi mini van/ oughta swing on yo ass/ spilled your drink everywhere/ on my shoes? dog it's cool but I meant what I said/ get these dollars bills wet then I'm on yo fucking head/ I ain't talking about a fitted but I'm with it/ I been in it and they got it documented/and you know what I don't spend it/pay my taxes CPA's/got it straight keep em with me/ and I'm smiling y'all ain't gone box me like Ron Isley/ and I'm shinning I'm getting brighter/ and I holler smoking with my nigga Rocka/ balling like I'm on a scholarship/ flying with the pilots this the lives nigga rhyming you can put that on yo mama

3rd verse (Buggs)

Her face down and ass up/ prolly cause a nigga got his cash up/ play Captain Kirk you tryna save her? u gon need more than a pastor/ O I'm so high this kush got me zoning/ I think that I'm floating I'm some where in space/ somebody call up nasa/ rappers sneak dissing o no we ain't trippen just know you can't get nothing past us/ I'm from the nati I been more than ready feel free if want get at us/ king Rocka my status/ and my queen be the baddest/ my money flip gymnastics/ more coming in that's fantastic/feel I'm greatest nigga, young Cassius/ they talk a good game but ain't showing me nothing/ these rappers been fronting/ the stage is my trap I got this shyt jumping/ the first sign of trouble my migo's is dumping/ really this rhyme scheme is nothing/ I'm lyrical stunting/ and deading that garbage y'all been pumping/ yo chick tryna kick it but I been punted/free $ee hussell now run it
