Lord forgive em they hid or history  divide us with religion/ u know what we need Devine intervention/ from the devil and its henchmen/ who  plagued my ppl wit this sickness/ brought crack to the projects they either dying from addiction or trapped in the system/ either way u victim/ cage u like a animal/and thats just how they depict em/ give u false scriptures/  so u never know u prayin to as they beat u/ with the billy club/ in the land of the equal/ this how they treat you/ racial profile call u a nigga who low down/ believe everyday this type bullshyt go down/ screams from the ghetto it echoes loud/  foul how dey just laugh over the sound/ for my sanity i write it all down/ so many tears over the years I coulda drowned/ to many inmates not enough cap and gowns to many escorts not enough wedding gowns/ to much pain not enough pure smiles/ my cuzin told me never stop chasing ya dreams/make sure u hold the it down as he sits in a cell locked down/ confined for a few years but say its safer in there than me being out here the real...

2nd verse
No way life ain't fair got us all in despair/ terrorize they  own homeland per organized plans have the new crews film it jus to leave us all scared / they use fear to take all your rights away/  got u singing songs at church Sundays  praying  that it take the  pain away/  I'm envisioning a better day/  that might not come in my lifetime/ its hard to put in a rhyme/ some choose to stay blind/ i seek enlightenment from the Devine/ that one day  peace we'll all find/ it's written in the sky/ they'll scheme ah never work/ what u put out u get back balance of the universe/ no conspiracy theories here/ jus truth in my verse mixed with alot hurt/ but what u expect?/ no telling wat these devils ah do next/ infected hip hop to make u all dumber/party off molly all summer and money make u cumma/fast gun blast in class /Camera flash Mirage from the demons/ inserted by they media/ wit no regard on they treating ya/ are your kids this is America/ they place we all live/ I mean something gotta give (the real)
