[Intro:]
AEIOU and Sometimes Y

[Chorus:]
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
If I got styles and you got styles
Then once in a while we got to move these vowels

[Verse 1: Speedis Tone (A)]
I specialize in snatching vertebrae
Break your anatomy down to A, call me atomic sensei
AKA B.J. McKay and my best friend Bear
Will hit you with Shirley Murdock and y'all can sing 'As We Lay'
What you gonna do, nothing 'cause you pootay es√©
The one that Prince saw wearing the raspberry beret
Enter VA., so my super can perform dismay
You'll be a boy in a man's hood looking like Trey
Getting faded like the redbone from Zhane
Think you tough in leather, I'll rob that ass like Runny Ray
You that nigga that was with jake still trying to walk away
But I ain't finished, hey hey, don't make me call you like  (Weeezaaayyy!!!!)

[Verse 2: Mad Skillz (E)]
Aiyo it's me, the M to the A to the D
Skillz ripping drum fills and I end it with a Z
I'm nice on the mic but that ain't hard for you to see
This rap thing I got locked, I swallowed the key
Now peep the stee 'cause since the year of '93
I've been known to eat, chew, shit, stew an MC
Quite frankly, the day that you'll see me
Is the same day you'll dunk and jump from the top of the key
Reside on northside but see sometimes I be
Getting biz at the crib of Lonnie B. & and; A.D
Recognized from Japan all the way to NYC
Still feel funny when I see my face on B.E.T
Till the day I die and have a preacher yelling over me
I wanna be known for representing VA vicinity
I shake rappers off like I do after I pee
Get it clear "From Where???" the debut C.D

[Chorus:]
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
If I got styles and you got styles
Then once in a while we got to move these vowels

[Verse 3: Danja Mowf (I)]
It's hard for me to understand why
People wanna test me when they know they're gonna die
Me oh my, why they wanna try
Like a sister with no thigh tryna do the butterfly
I, say bye bye like Guy
Then dive into your ass buckaroo banzai
Dry your eye, please don't cry
I sing a lullabye before I sting you like a horse fly
Of course my, style will make you testify
I bet you fry like a pie on an electric eye
F' a sword, I ain't no Shang-Hai samurai
But in your boti boy head boom bye bye

[Verse 4: Lonnie B (O)]
Yo! Every since a brother went solo
I've been known to grab the microphone and kick the Willie Bobo
Far from so-so when it comes to sex even your Ho know
We did it To-To style for an hour at the hojo
Here's a photo of her sucking on me like a Rolo
And in this one she was cumming or either thinking about some Go-Go
I turned your little Ho into a dancer like JoJo
Or maybe like Donnie, Poo Poo and Fo Fo
It's true yo, I am a Little Vicious like Cujo
'cause I keep three Glocks in the trunk of my Peugeot
Mess around, you'll be missing like that crew called Menudo
They wouldn't find you if they searched from Mercury to
Pluto

[Chorus:]
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
If I got styles and you got styles
Then once in a while we got to move these vowels

[Verse 5: Kalonji The Immortal (U)]
I'm talking to the letter U
As if U were a person on an abstract Avenue where I construe
The vowel moving U into an accented zoo
That's making you go ooooh
You, be trying to find styles like a clue
So I left old ones on the floor like residue
See what you saying now to me ain't nothing new
You got a glass jaw making this style see through
My brain is a point of view holding
Knowledge unseen like cats on a oriental menu
Kalonji the immortal styles continue
To stay sharp like a tuxedo dressed Gingsu
To who is two or more too much of a crew
Of true friends who be super like glue
If it's you, don't argue 'cause I'll still pursue
To move the vowel you asked me by saying was that you?

[Chorus:]
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
Once in a while we got to move these vowels
If I got styles and you got styles
Then once in a while we got to move these vowels
