[Lonnie B]
See, we still unseen, know what I'm saying?
Still unseen, and since you still looking
We're gonna bring it

[Danja Mowf]
Yo, the mistake that is made many times that which aches in my mind
Is when fakes try to rhyme and they take petty lines
To put stakes against mine but I breaks them like spines
Cause I make plenty rhymes that are dimes
I'm often misunderstood cause I never soften, would
You look as good in a coffin, should
You think twice or thrice your lady
Was on my knot getting hot in a shady spot
Screaming "Give me what you got"
Don't stop get it get it, when I hit it hit it
Shit it's hard being me
Did it did it occur that you ain't seeing me?
Quit it quit it, give up the mic device B
Cause you'll never be as nice as me, G, forget it
I lit it like GE cause me-ee be-ee
The-ee D-ee A-N-J-A M-O-W-F, ee hee
You crack me up like Hump-deehee Dump-deehee
Just for thinking you can see me

[Speedis Toine]
How should I attack this? Me the cool cat like Ratcliff
For all the MC's who act as if I won't flip them on a cactus
Point me towards the mattress
I make your career go backwards like a dyslexic actress
You shouldn't try to attack this, I use you MC's for practice
While I greet you back with
Something that your front took straight up digested and ate up
While you went to sleep seems you couldn't wait up
Kill you again and again, can't stop or won't stop
Til I squeeze your body into a dot
Very rarely do I break up the work you can't make up
Stains so strong Bounty couldn't take up, so wake up
Imagine over 100 dinosaurs attacking you
That's my crew, straight from the VA zoo
Keep your head up or be ready to die
Yours truly, SupaFriendz franchise, oops, we caught you by suprise

[Mad Skillz]
While you niggas get upset, I'm a get to the point
It's me, the nigga that slayed "E" on the vowel joint
And a thousand attempts have been made to stop this
The niggas who talk shit and got sit, I'm a fill your 40 bottles with hot piss
Against the grain the ?Paraquan? is insane
Shorty, you the aft, I'm in the cockpit of the plane
I'm running through niggas, verbal abuse to do niggas
Split one nigga's opinion and have him thinking like two niggas
A rhyming nightmare for all you dreamers
You want me to fall? I'm on top of the game like an arena
I got your bitch showing me her tactics
While your wack ass swole at home fucking the hole in your mattress
The fact is that you ought to know the half
My staff's better, we bag the cheddar like Kraft
So fuck yapping, I specialize in MC slapping
I give a fuck about these noncircumsized niggas rapping
If words had actions, mine would be crazy
And yours would make about as much noise as a stillborn baby
So put it back in the womb nigga, remix it
See the shit is coming straight so you ain't got to get it twisted
I'm dead aim, so fuck being a target
Son you wouldn't blow up if you was giving head on the
Top floor of the fucking Stock Market
So flip your jibs and dodge your bids
I'm trying to get my ends to meet, fuck, and have some kids

[MynBenda]
Your preceptual attributes seem odd
In my face you'll see the indescribable beauty of God
I slay rappers in the euthanasia
Beauty of the Nexus with paragraphics that's infectious
Like the menegitis mind of conceptual inventions
That only hold murderous intentions
I shine in the Nimbus, touch entities which leaves MC's
Stuck in between parenthesis cause my
Frequency consumes attitives from 50 year old secrecy rooms
I got the Spielberg, the ill verbs, the real words
That actually baffles and kills nerds
And halts and brings forth new days
Cause I walk in the image of the one you praise
I'm labeled as the unconcievable
Or absolutely, completely, utterly unbelievable

[Javon]
I write horrific, rotate my journals like Polaris
Murder messiah, upon grave death I cherish
Guard the barracks like Elvis, so who you swearing at?
Set to lead a nation of terrorists like Arafat
With this track my voice travels through liquid interludes
Decapitating apostles in cerimonal underground duels
Child or greater, every act of war is fatal
Air strike Tiger Force, marine deep ocean naval
Take a wiff of this contagious (Mortuary) Mentho-lyptus
Digest the flesh of rappers like I'm poetically carniverous
Conquest built on starting crusades and riots
Putting yellow journalists under pressure to keep quiet
About the crew once this treacherous sound enters orbit
We move forward with unauthorized severe orphans
Javon the black emperor, let the poison be administered
Throughout your body mathematically like integers
No way of escaping the depths and grasps of harm
Sign your Biblical will with dead angel arms

[Lil' Rock]
I'm put on the Earth in the route to do things, known by two names
"The Boulder" - "Lil' Rock", yo let's start a new game
I'm a throw darts at the clowns with quarter moon fame
Get attached with a lot of shit we gonna soon gain
Sharpshooter, smooth aim, can flash two flames
You play niggas fuck around and get hung by fat shoestrings
Vibin' with a bat and a cane - not Bruce Wayne
See it coming to a nigga, and my crew do same
Me and Shawnie Poo swing, gin and juice brew swings
And they thing we all about that weed
I got a plan to make some grands in the southern pot land
And it's set for all to see
If we was teams you would forfeit
Took a long road with Tims and walked it
Rap rules I absorbed it and still get high
Colonel's log the main target is to reach the orbit with some
Flavors that be distorted, if they real inside, so take heed
And bring your punk ass to Justice League
It ain't going to be no warm welcoming

[Lonnie B]
I dedicate this to those who ask me "Lonnie, when your shit going to drop?"
In a minute, yeah, it's time for me to get my props
And blow the spot up, niggas making loot hold your knot up
My friends be super like the cat (Don Dada)
I ain't scared of no man, you want it you can get it
We can battle on the phone, your girl got my digits
What? I'm a player with more game than your Sega
Had your girl shaking like a hustler's pager when I ate her
Banged her from the back, bust one off on her butt cheeks
She went and told her friends now they all want to fuck me
From the cute to the ugly, skinny to the chubby
These seven inches they like the way I work it, money
I'm on top of the world like Da Brat and I'm SoSo Def
That I should use a hearing aid for my logo
Y'all get the photo, and now you're too slow, yo
(Woop woop) That's the sound of the po po
I'm 5 foot 10, 200 lb's
Known citywide from Highland Park to Belle Mead
Been rapping 10 years, ain't shit y'all can tell me
Bagged so many dimes I should stop rapping and sell weed
