Yeahh
	Yea yeah
	I've been, watching you
	Bring your body, next to mine

[Danja Mowf]
Yo
They say that lust will make a man rush
Into situations where premeditation is a must
But, lust turns brain cells to dust
Thus we, focus on the nut bust
And keep it hush-hush, til I discuss us
When my brown skin heroin walked in
Thorough in, all respects of the word
But sex was the word
You woulda thought it absurd
If you had heard, what had occurred, in my brain
I refrain to explain the game
But it's well known, as wild oats get sewn
Another touchdown scored in your erogenous zone
As balls get spiked I swoosh like Nike
To the next victim to trick them and stick them
With the rest of my conquest, watching
And waiting, to get your body undressed (I confess)

	I've been, watching you
	Bring your body, next to mine
	(Bring your body next to mine)
	I've been, watching you
	Bring your body, (bring your body) next to mine
	(next to mine)

I bear witness to your physical fitness existence
A straight dime piece like a minute of long distance
For instance, 36 by, 24 by, 36 I, was never good at mathematics
But your status is the fattest in ghettofabulous terms
Therefore I'm not concerned
Withcha mental capacity, yo' college degree
Basically, just getting me, to between your knees
Please, I know my thesis, was full of feces
And left your heart in pieces like Reese's
But my +Species+ is +Predator+ (Predator)
Things that I do keep me two steps ahead of ya, heh
I'd love to get your body close, but
Post-ejaculation I'm ghost
Supposed if I boast from coast to coast
Diagnose that it's your body that I chose the most
(That's how it goes)

	(I've been watching you yeah!)
	I've been, watching you
	Bring your body, next to mine
	(Bring your sexy body, bring it next to mine)
Yeah, c'mon
	I've been, watching you
	Bring your body, next to mine

Your physical being is worth seeing, your body is dope
When we stroke, I'm OD'ing, no rehab needed
I stabbed and jabbed until it bleeded
Waited five days, then I repeated
Treated your wack conversation as the track to penetration
Gave no indication to my thoughts of fornication
And titillation, patient-ly
Waitin for you to start, tastin, me, see, comprehend
I don't need a friend, I need a lover
Cause if ain't yo' tongue it's in one ear and out the other
Discover, it's just the facts of life
You don't like it when I act so trife?
You can cut like an Exacto knife, quick and precise, aight?
I don't wanna fight, I want your body tonight
Is that complex to you, me gettin next to you
If for only to have sex witchu?  Let me know Boo

	I've been (I've been watching you) watching you
	(for so long) Bring your body, next to mine
	(Bring your body next to mine)
Yes, ahh, c'mon, yeah
	I've been, watching you
	(I've been watching you)
	Bring your body, next to mine
Yes, ahhh
	(I just want your sexy body)
	I've been, watching you
Uhhh, yes
	Bring your body, next to mine
	(Bring your body next to mine)
	I've been, watching you (I've been watching you)
	Bring your body, next to mine
