[Verse 1:]
(We got it all
Soo.?)
So tell your friends about concept
And all the things you heard 'em say
Rock your neck so hard that he can break your vertebrae
Team will make the murder rate increase when they servin', aim
The innocent bystanders as we bond standin' in our lane
Maximized labels got more prisoners than Alcatraz
System got more chips than Bill Gates' data has
Matter of fact
Imma break myself out of it
With lines so heavy they're embedded from the sound of it
The unsigned laced it
Don't undermine greatness
Don't wonder why these other guys don't fuck with my placement
I'm following no guidelines
I'm fathering how I rhyme
I'm clocking in, astonishing
I'm polishing my 'shantan

[Verse 2:]
It's sort of simmlar to a cyclone
I write poems with sick cyclable synergy
Mirroring the effects of ingested hennessy (Speak...)
Shit(oh shit), religiously like, Christ was dizzy
CVD, epitome of this music you use it pitifully
I've been typically know for getting silly for years
Recently I've been lazy (yawn), like insert simile here
It'll be wierd when I crush your career without trying
Like stepping on ant hills your man yells in (silence)
We giants who leave your section like a war zone
Whores all nice but we rocking like the doors gone (doors gone?)
Yeah it's of the hinges (Oooooh)
When I kick it, shit no biggie
When the Brown bags in your system
Makes your sister wanna lick me
See your sounds kinda stale and chewy like old pork rhymes
While we swing the boom like a sailor turning portside
Short fry?
You can never fuck with us, don't try
My shit drops, and it stops, the hip hop, apartheid

[Verse 3:]
Well I'm the cock of the walk
Other motherfuckers are chicken shit
Stricken with conditions that only my prescription fits
Syphilis slang that got their climmets congested
It's simple and plain for you to mimic the best, kid
But you ain't on the level to start shit with the devil incarnate
Her lengend, my art
He's in the dredded, its just far fetched
Her scar techs lacerate your veteran
Confusing new jacks and captivating veterans
Cats that's better than who? Better than who?
I prefer to chill and exist to still in the bliss
Cause even militants wish
That 'out the kill and assist
They could just recline without the feel of the wrist
So come beat George Foremans grilling a bitch
Untill he recognizes that I'm as ill as it gets
Punk crews gets fuck you's , to sit with the dead
Brown bag got the syllabus grip
Check it out (Haha)

[Verse 4:]
Hey yo, they speak of change but still not one thing is different
Reach deep into my pockets but now all I feel is lint in there
It's common to try and find forever whether or not
They understand they should try to chase symphony
I'm self scientific
Kill it, start it, Imma finnish it
In reason, it's deep, can't recycle what I'm speaking
My logic, these words are rightful triggered inner feelings
My cousin just got back from Iraq, his mother squeezed him
Like the trigger on his rifle back in Iraq
He got home, didn't know that he would have to adapt
To the change, everything is different, time moved on
Friends don't speak to one another, nothing the same since he's gone
Life spinning out of control, feel deep in his soul
It only took him 2 years time, to lose everything that he owned
The cards are dealt from a clock's hand
The lock could change in time
The only thing that you can't stop
So you ain't wasting mine, no
