Ayyo
Get nice, shoot dice, skip the
Small talk, son.  Advance to Boardwalk
Collect the properties and profit, expand and make
Dough, yo, slide past Go

[Verse 1: Cella Dwellas]
[Phantasm]
Yo, check
The drama as the saga starts to unfold to
Advance and pass Go and get the pot of gold.  In
The Mediterranean, met this fly lady, and
She had two ‘nothers, the rich Parker Brothers on
The run from the IRS for income tax
After this heist, son, we’re sitting on stacks.  In
This new community, looking for the treasure chest, took
A wrong left turn—fuck it, yo.  Nevertheless, it’s
My fault, kid, we ended up on Baltic,  off-
-course, but, still, we ain’t taking a loss.  There
He go, Reading at the Railroad in his Porsche, waiting
For his brother to come in on the iron horse
[U.G.]
“Can It Be So
Simple” playing in my rental on Oriental
Avenue, passing through Connecticut, got
To get to Vermont just to visit Matt Life in
The clink.  I’m back for stolen minks and snatching links
[Phantasm]
At Saint
Charles Place, let me check Digga and Masta Ace and
The I-N-C.—they own Electric Company. Next
Is the State of Virginia, where I’m
A don and got Mad Skillz like Shaquan. At
The train station, we’re waiting for my Pennsylvania connect
To come through and show us love and respect.  Don’t even
Take aim ‘cause he’s a Saint like James, and when you’re
Done with the body, burn him in the flames
[U.G.]
Sipping Hen-
-nessy on Tennessee with Hav and P. See
Schott Free asked me to walk to New York Avenue
Bagged two chicks who whisper stats.  At Free
Parking, we see Lou Diamonds with Tony Starks, and
Some kid tried to buck me off Kentucky, some gang named
Chance with bandanas,  so I ran to Indiana
Illa Noyz/Illinois and his boys held me down, they got my back, pass
The gat.  Yes, I’m just cool like that

[Verse 2: Cella Dwellas]
[Phantasm]
It’s after
3, yo.  We at B&O Amtrak and Marvin
Gardens, a player like Phantasm is starving
Check the fountain and see if the Water Works while I
Send four messengers to Ventor
[U.G.]
I was on
Atlantic with my man quick to snatch jewels and hit
The scale, see 50, didn’t wanna go to jail on Pennsyl-
-vania.  I met Lorraina, she had on Guess, she said
“You need a vest going through Community Chest”
Or NC, North Carolina if you visit
“You look exquisite, trail ‘goose made by Pacific.”  Kick the
Short line, shorty was mine, she was with it
I got the digits, but never got the chance to hit it
[Phantasm]
At Park
Place, hit the Parker Brothers’ safe and made
A killing and skated with about two million, but
We got to pay tax on the luxuries.  The Cella
Dwellas’ plan is to expand and live comfortably
