[Verse 1: Phantasm]
The Good
Dwellas still generating mad cash
U.G. got the NYC on smash.  Call me
Ted DiBiase—I’m worth about a Million, Man
What’s the plan?  I stay Dapper like Dan, decked-out
In Helly Hansen, went to Panama and bought
A mansion with a ranch, and now I ride on
Horses, his-and-her Porsches.  Once a month
I fly back out to meet with crime bosses
Still gun-trafficking and pushing kis
The Tall Man’s international, now I’m overseas
Setting up shops, no more nickel and dime, jerk
Chicken shops—noow we graduated to the yachts
And private helicopters and private doctors
I’ll erase ya ‘cause St. Ides chase my Vodka
Niggas living out their dreams through schemes
My right-hand man Tyheim still with my team
So let’s get deep (Deep), deep into the text (Text)
Dwellas on the remix, U.G., show ‘em how we flex

[Verse 2: U.G.]
See how I’m riding jet
Skis in Hawaii.  The NYC’s on lock
Rocks and stones, brim, Timbs, and rims keep
Me dipped.  I whip speedboats on the shores of Puerto
Rico, I bought a black panther last week.  No
More petty stick-ups or running from the coppers
Now I flash cash and fly my own helicopter, got a
Castle in New England, bringing in endangered
Species, two koala bears for this cheese
Private jets, TV sets, inches in the 40’s
Shorties from Spain with the champagne in my domain
Shirt still Guess, butter dipped with flavor
Off goes the pager—it’s Phan’, it must be major
He put in triple 3’s—that’s the code of the CD’s
Took off the skis and brushed the snow off my knees
Up in the Catskill Mountains, taking lessons how
To ski.  See, we, take you on a journey, yo

[Hook: U.G. and Phantasm]
Mob hats, cigars, fat cars, and cellulars
It all comes together when you’re rolling with the Good Dwellas
Give me the Benz, the ends, and the skins
It all comes together when you’re rolling with the Good Dwellas

[Verse 3: Phantasm and U.G.]
Meet me
At JFK.  Coming back to the USA
Destination: BK.  My son’s
Missing, got snatched up while he was pissing on
His trip fishing, now Papa Large is on a mission.  Yo
My ETA at JFK was three
MPV, jewelry like Mr. T, sipping
Don P, waiting for my man to fly in, got two chicks
They’re both thick, light-skinned, and one’s Hawaiian.  Target’s
Back on the map, living like fat cat, he runs with
Funk Flex, new alias is Big Kap.  Son
I know that the show’s at The Mecca.  Grab your TECs
And a vest.  It might get wild like the west.  So we
Jumped in the NSX and stashed the TECs
Walked in and put the Polo in the coat check, bought some
Moet, downed a bottle quick and bagged this model chick
Named Tamika.  Eureka!  There he go by
The speaker.  Tonight’s the night.  I got the bouncer on
The right build like Mike in infrared sight.  I’m sitting by
The bar, choking two bottles of Mo’-Mo’ for dolo
Heavy like Slick Rick, I bagged this thick Asian chick named
May Ling.  Her thing was dancing in bars in G-strings
She peeped my rings and pulled me upstairs to V.I.P
“What’s your hobby?”  “I teach karate, boo, for protection”
Pushed her, cocked the weapon as Big Kap stepped in
The door.  “Get on the floor, nigga.  Where’s Ty at?”
“He’s in the back!”  “Get up, black.” I untied the straps off
His arms.  “Where’s my pops?”  I heard two shots clap
Got grazed in the back, I turned around, busting at nothing
Downstairs, I’m walking through the crowd, bleeding slowly
It’s Phan’.  “Yo, son, homie, I’m dizzy.”  “Where is he?”
“Ty’s right here.”  “Where’s Big Kap?”  “He’s in the trunk of the Ac’
Let’s go and throw his body off the Verrazzano, yo”
