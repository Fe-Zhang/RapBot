[Intro]
Tell em, damn
Paper route, bitch I'm on my paper route
Paper route, paper route
All this fucking paper wow
Bitch I'm on my paper route
All this fucking paper wow, wow, wow
All this fucking paper wow
Bitch I'm on my people route
All this fucking paper (All this x5)
Whoo, Tell em, whoo, whoo, tell them, whoo, whoo, tell them, whoo, like a, yeah, yeah

[Hook: P Dice]
Tell em bums leave me 'lone
'Cause I'm on my paper route
Friends they come and they go
But I keep that paper round
When them ones hit the floor
Girl pick up that paper now
Tell them them ones leave me 'lone
'Cause I'm on a paper route
