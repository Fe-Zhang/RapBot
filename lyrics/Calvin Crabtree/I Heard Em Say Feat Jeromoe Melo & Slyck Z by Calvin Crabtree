[Verse 1: Slyck Z]

I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I be smoking on a log
Every where I go I'm Bringing the fog
And you Niggas can't even touch Slyck
If so they would slip, dip and fall
Nigga I'm a ball till my momma hits the wall
My back never to the wall if you clowns want to brawl
If the police come around I got lock jaw
No condom on, Man fuck the law
Yeah,.. I'm on a mother fucking trip
A trip to mars, I don't need a spaceship
Just a couple blunt and a ot of drink
Put them pills down now, Tell me what you think
No drugs in the bank, Had to go and stash that
But she wearing them jeans that show her ass crack
Fuck you hater I ain't stopping
I got my mother fucking mind in my pocket

[Hook: Jeromoe Melo]

I heard em say a lot of cool things about me
But at the same time they the only ones hate me
They the only ones hate me
They the only ones hate
I do my shit, Do my own damn thing
I don't give a damn if I heard them mother fucker hate me
If those mother fucker hate me
If the other niggas hate me

[Verse 2: Calvin Crabtree]

Still Servin' Em'
Keep the peace and get pussy
That is all that is all that's on my mind, I'm set
Brother that you'll never forget
Can tell he eats his supper meat and potatoes with the whole weat bread
Type of dude to step up drunk off some MD 20/20 just a bobbing his head
Spitting game as he pass, Get the girls smiling like they chiefed
Still I'm rolling hard like a colonel blunt in my mouth
Hat cocked to the left
Scar under my right eye looking like tear tracks, I'm balling
Can't touch me, O my level?
I stay spitting
Smoking Winston and Marlboro light
Trying to find new pussy and dodge them haters trying to fight
Yea you alright, Bout like having cable, Same shit every night
I stay on my feat stepping out stout like some brute cologne
That thug Calvin Still in the house tonight
Mother fucker still got it, He Servin Em' , Clowning

[Hook: Jeromoe Melo]

I heard em say a lot of cool things about me
But at the same time they the only ones hate me
They the only ones hate me
They the only ones hate
I do my shit, Do my own damn thing
I don't give a damn if I heard them mother fucker hate me
If those mother fucker hate me
If the other niggas hate me (x 2)

[Verse 3: Jeromoe Melo]

Yeah I don't even try
Cause I got the tools I need to be fly
I said
Baby I don't even try because I got the tools I need to get high
Call me a monster
Call me what you want
I'm the nigga that you talk about
The guy you hate on
Cal me a gangster
Call me what you want
I'm the only one bad enough to get what I want
Call me a monster
Call me what you want
I'm the nigga that you talk about
The guy you hate on
Cal me a gangster
Call me what you want
I'm the only one bad enough to get what I want

[Hook: Jeromoe Melo]

I heard em say a lot of cool things about me
But at the same time they the only ones hate me
They the only ones hate me
They the only ones hate
I do my shit, Do my own damn thing
I don't give a damn if I heard them mother fucker hate me
If those mother fucker hate me
If the other niggas hate me (x 2)
