Yeah this is Calvin Crabtree the greatest there is
The greatest the was and the greatest there ever will be
Espsaly for you baby

My lover, My Lady , My life , The only one
Putting it down the way you do
Ooo so sweet throw me down on the bed
Seduce me girl introduce me to you fantasy
I can't believe you would ever be this way
I mean you that sweet lil girl
It came as a shock
Ain't even herd you name from the hommies on the block
The type to stay at home and read a book
Took one look at me and was hooked
I could tell you was waiting on someone to come in your life you could trust
Also grind and make sweet love you my dove doll baby
Sexual fantasy mistress lady
Smiles something amazing
Make me want to lick what's dripping down them thighs like its gravy (baby baby!)
You drive me crazy making me want to speak
So I grabbed my pen and loaded up a beat
So so sweet is what she is
Her pussy smelling like honey
Now this ain't play-boi but we get down like bunny's

She my lady my baby only thing I need in my life she my sweet thing make me load up a beat and sing she so sexy seductive and neat (x2)

First come first serve
Naaaw she give me what I deserve
And its only for me and she let me run free
She know she the only one if she trying to be that
But I don't question
Cause if she wouldn't she wouldn't let me tear out that back
Madder of fact she been the best to me
Always willing when she get the time to be next to me
She like a quest to me
Something I'm trying to get at and take it to the next level
You my girl and I can't let you go
No one but you gets my affection
Yo check it honey I'm trying to be deep like when I'm inside you
Ill always be right by you come on ma you know no one can do

You my woman and just make me want to boast
When it comes to your love no one can come close
