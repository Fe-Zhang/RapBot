(Hook)
I just wanna hold you and vibe with you
Look you in your eyes and never lie to you
Roll up a blunt, spark up, get high with you
Let's make love, don’t wanna fight with you

I just wanna hold you and vibe with you
Look you in your eyes and never lie to you
Roll up a blunt, spark up, get high with you
Let's make love, don't wanna fight with you

(Verse 1)
Slim thick shawty; fine like a bottle of wine
With those red lips man; got me mesmerized
You a gift from heaven, god’s greatest design
Let's conversate, lemme know what's on your mind
Cause you got that vibe that makes me feel alive
Tight between those thighs, the type of shit I like
Got me lifted, shifted higher than the sky
Don't play no games, you wanna be my ride or die

(Hook)
I just wanna hold you and vibe with you
Look you in your eyes and never lie to you
Roll up a blunt, spark up, get high with you
Let's make love, don't wanna fight with you

I just wanna hold you and vibe with you
Look you in your eyes and never lie to you
Roll up a blunt, spark up, get high with you
Let's make love, don't wanna fight with you

(Verse 2)
Lemme take you out; maybe to the galleria
Go out to eat; maybe hit the museum
Far from a basic bitch, far from a diva
Love watching those hips rockin’ like Aaliyah
Dudes try to holla but you treat em like strangers
Smelling like lavender, I just wanna taste ya
You got that good good; keeps me crawling back
Switch up on ya, do you dirty; never that, that’s a fact

(Hook)
I just wanna hold you and vibe with you
Look you in your eyes and never lie to you
Roll up a blunt, spark up, get high with you
Let's make love, don’t wanna fight with you

I just wanna hold you and vibe with you
Look you in your eyes and never lie to you
Roll up a blunt, spark up, get high with you
Let's make love, don't wanna fight with you

(Verse 3 - Bridge)
Holla back, holla back if you tryna get it cracking
Girl you so fanatic
I might have to hit the breaks on you
Not just one take on you
All day on you; make the world shake up
Make your body shake
Holla back, holla back if you tryna get it cracking
Girl you so fanatic
I might have to hit the breaks on you
Not just one take on you
All day on you; make the world shake up
Make your body shake
