[Verse 1]
So it's me and fuckin' buddy, right?
Doing 'er up on a Friday night
Like no big deal, just a couple of pops
Half pack of buds, couple of shots
Might as well make a night of 'er, right? (yeah)
Cause I don't drink much but I do drink a lot
Like I'll have four, five, six
Ten fuckin' beers before I catch a buzz (fuck bud)
Most guys be frigged right out (yeah)
I kill a two-four by six o'clock
Got a two-six stashed in the back of the truck
And I pretty much don't give a half a fuck
Like friggin' whoa
And I'm hackin' a dart while I'm gassin' up
Might just roll right past the club
But not right fast, just fast enough

[Bridge]
Just fast enough, bud
Just fast enough (fuck yeah)
Just fast enough
Not right fast, just fast enough
Just fast enough, bud (right)
Just fast enough
Just fast enough
Not right fast, just fast enough

[Hook]
Can I get a "Oh fuck yeah bud!" from the back to the front?
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
Can I get a "Oh fuck yeah bud!" from the back to the front?
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
Oh, oh, oh fuck yeah bud from the back to the front
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
Can I get a "Oh fuck yeah bud!" from the back to the front?
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!

[Verse 2]
Head 'er into town
Lean right back, slow right down
Call that "turkey low"
Is that fast enough? Just ask around (oh fuck yeah)
Get the windows up, rolled up rims, tiny hose cups
Just swimming in cigarette butts
Fuckin' live it up bud, just kickin' up dust
Seen buddy on the road
Finger wave, get nice and slow
Stop for a bit, fuckin' shootin' the shit
Like, "Hey, 'sup bud, how's she goin'?" (Good! And you?)
Fuck, got an extra dart? (Yup)
Late for work, fuckin' truck won't start
Out of smokes, (shit) beer store's closed (fuck)
Fuck bud, that's how she goes
Friggin' life's a bitch
Most guys get pissed, I get right pissed
Like just keep givin' 'er shit
'Til you pretty much got no shits to give
Like friggin' wha
Fucked right up backin' out the truck
Might just roll right past the dump
But not right fast, just fast enough

[Bridge]
Just fast enough, bud
Just fast enough (fuck yeah)
Just fast enough
Not right fast, just fast enough
Just fast enough, bud (right)
Just fast enough
Just fast enough
Not right fast, just fast enough

[Hook]
Can I get a "Oh fuck yeah bud!" from the back to the front?
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
Can I get a "Oh fuck yeah bud!" from the back to the front?
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
Oh, oh, oh fuck yeah bud from the back to the front
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
Can I get a "Oh fuck yeah bud!" from the back to the front?
Oh fuck yeah bud, oh fuck yeah!
