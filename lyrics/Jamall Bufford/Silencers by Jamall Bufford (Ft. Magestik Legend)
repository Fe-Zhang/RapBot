[Verse1: Jamall Bufford]

On the phone talking money while I bend the curb
Bending rules so I’m hurting feelings like I pinched a nerve
In my city niggas think I blew up like the Hindenburg
So I let em believe it I can think of plenty worse
Hop out, throw a dollar to a homeless man
He said “Spare a little more young brotha I know you can”
Wish I could share more paper but I’m one
Check away from being ya next door neighbor
He said “Por Favor” in Ingles
Then he said “I ain’t gon spend it on no E&J”
I said that’s good to know these days
So I gave him 25 cents, said “Keep the change”

[Chorus: Magestik Legend]

As I ride through the city lights
Got my mind on getting by
That's the way I gotta move
Everyday every night
(repeat)

[Verse2: Jamall Bufford]

On the phone talking money while I bend the curb
Engine pur beatin down ya block like Leonard/Hearns
Rehabilitated like I left a prison sentence served
Bout my business, Stern like commissioners
Getting to the paper mane, Rakim in ‘88
Paid In Full favorite statement fish is my favorite plate
Yeah I do this on the day to day
Killing beats Cain and Abel listen to the 808s

They talk loud, but we got them silencers
Burner after burner they be pilin´ up
And another one u can line em up
You see just how we working
They talk loud, but we got them silencers
Burner after burner they be pilin´ up
And another one u can line em up
You know we always serving

[Chorus: Magestik Legend]

As I ride through the city lights
Got my mind on gettin by
That's the way I gotta move
Everyday every night
(repeat)

[Verse3: Jamall Bufford]

Big bills Mr. Russell
I need em in my wallet & much more than a couple
This isn't just a hobby but far more than a hustle so I'm
Workin til I'm resting with my aunties & my uncles
Heavenly, since seventeen it’s been this rapping thing
Hip-Hop was my Coretta King, yeah I had a dream
Manifested fruition
Everyday I'm in the kitchen cooking up some nutrition
Amen I need that daily bread
Motive stay motivated pray before I lay in bed
New year new moves you doing the stanky leg
Still on that same old I'm fresher than some baby's breath
In a bouquet on a wedding day
Married to the money never throw it when I celebrate
I need every penny, so whatever I'm spendin´
Better come back twofold do a 720 [?]

[Chorus: Magestik Legend]

As I ride through the city lights
Got my mind on gettin by
That's the way I gotta move
Everyday every night
(repeat)

[Jamall Bufford]

They talk loud, but we got them silencers
Burner after burner they be pilin´ up
And another one u can line em up
You see just how we working
They talk loud, but we got them silencers
Burner after burner they be pilin´ up
And another one u can line em up
You know we always serving
