Radiant black man in your state again
Your favorite transplant, moving crowds
The Bay before back down to LA and then
In that A in a packed house like we moving out
The sweet science, elite rhyming
Complete mind bend
In deep concentration with each concept
But really, though, you already know
Hard body raps with that hard headed flow
She say she want that hard work and she want it slow
Cut her like a barber trim on the low then I'm gone on my
Outer space traveling to modern day Babylon
Cloudy grey ambience surrounded by a massive fog
Climbing Jacob's ladder all the way to afterthoughts
Prior to my past involvements when I had the force
With me on a voyage to Atlantis, fantastic
Bandwagon full of them ex antagonists
Ride with me like I was Jesse Lee in 'Posse'
Enemies stay scheming that's ponzi for dollar bills
Dead Clintons could turn Gandhi to Gotti
Monster, problem since Ronnie and Bobby
Ricky, Mike and Ralph was new to it in Boston
Author, James Baldwin aiming assault weapons
Caution, you don't wanna get caught in the crosshairs
Heavy artillery and I ain't talking no barbells
All hail Jamall, call me sire
These niggas say that weed don't cut it, man, they trying to get
Higher, walk through the fire
My mind gone, survivor
Bloodstream flooded with the finest
My mind blown, they trying to get higher
Higher, walk through the fire
My mind gone, survivor
Bloodstream flooded with the finest
My mind blown, they trying to get higher
They put them hard drugs up in our blood
Get your heart pumping like a sparkplug
They on that stardust for the stardom
Long as you make it up, fuck where you start from
They put them hard drugs up in our blood
Get your heart pumping like a sparkplug
They on that stardust for the stardom
Long as you make it up, fuck where you start from
And these niggas out here dying to be hard
Throwing up signs just to find who they are
Lost in a world full of diamonds and cars
Welcomes you with open arms, crucified on the cross
Once upon a time you was just like me
But now you're too high with your drug I.V
Trying to keep it 33.3 times 3
But that ain't enough for you and me to find peace, peace
