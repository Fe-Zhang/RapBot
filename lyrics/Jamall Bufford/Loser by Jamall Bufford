Verse 1:
Loser
I guess the shoe fits
So I’m suited and booted just like the groomsmen
Handful of berries and juices, prince of Zamunda
If I like her, then maybe I should pursue her
Put a ring on it before jumping to groom first
I know why the caged bluebird singing like Future
Cause he knows he might lose her
If another man decides to choose her. (Damn)
I know ya’ll ain’t accustomed to me cussing, but f*** it
I done lost enough and I’m dusted and disgusted
My money coming up shorter than (Demonte Boggs?) and a jump ball
Try to make her stay or let her go, tough call
It could literally go either way, latch harder
I told her I’ll make it big one day, and be a pop star
Clearly, that s*** was not in the cards
Not playing with a full deck
I should have stopped from the start, damn

Chorus:
Loser. I’m losing it. (x 4)

Verse 2:
Bare minimum of 11 dollars I share 10 of em
I know nowadays that’s a rare sentiment
N****** is sick, they rather share chlamydia
And I don’t relate, I feel like I’m from Area 51
Alien from a distant sun
Traveling and what I’m seeing got me unraveling
Losing my hair, I had to shave it bald
I need glasses when I drive just to save a soul
I gotta stretch thoroughly before I play some ball
Other than that, I guess I’m just the same Jamall
A little older, a little wiser maybe
Maybe not, who am I kidding I’m still like a baby
I know that sounds oxymoronic like when night and day meet
But that’s the very beauty of a life so crazy
Maybe I’m jaded, or maybe this drink got me faded
Like Kid N Play in the late 80s. I’m losing it

Chorus:
Loser. (I’m a loser, baby.) I’m losing it
Loser. (x3) (I’m a loser baby why don’t you…) I’m losing it
Loser. (x3) (I’m a loser.) I’m losing it
Loser. (x5) (I’m a loser baby why don’t you kill me?) I’m losing it
I’m a loser baby why don’t you kill me? I’m a loser
