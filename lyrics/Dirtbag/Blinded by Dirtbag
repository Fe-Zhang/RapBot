[Intro]
Goth bitch and she lookin' like a ghost
Get inside, my feelings so low
Fuck you up, if you fuckin' with my bros
Digiage be my gang

[Chrous]
Fuck these drugs
Eyes closed can't even see
Sittin' in the clouds there's no place I'd rather be
Shawty hit my phone sayin' do you love me
I know i'm not shit but you gotta trust me
Angel be my wings, but there's demons in my heart
Let thoughts in my head, be tearin' me apart
Baby by my side, that's my lil sweet heart
When I knew my whole life was gonna fall apart
Plug!

[Verse 1]
Goth bitch and she lookin' like a ghost
Get inside, my feelings so low
Fuck you up, if you fuckin' with my bros
Digiage be my gang, that's my home
Cemetery baby put me in a casket
All these drugs got my heart getting sadder
Might be goin' crazy put me in a jacket
Burnin' up, in the fire, got the matches
I just popped a bean so I'm swerving in the whip
She say do you love me tell lil shawty get a grip
Didn't love me back then, now I'm fuckin' on his bitch
Runnin' with my bros I ain't never gonna switch yeah
Y'all ain't gettin' money like me
Fuckin' up a check, I be countin' all this green
2018 yeah we doin' be things
Imma make it up and I'm only 18

[Chrous]
Fuck these drugs
Eyes closed can't even see
Sittin' in the clouds there's no place I'd rather be
Shawty hit my phone sayin' do you love me
I know i'm not shit but you gotta trust me
Angel be my wings, but there's demons in my heart
Let thoughts in my head, be tearin' me apart
Baby by my side, that's my lil sweet heart
When I knew my whole life was gonna fall apart
Plug!
