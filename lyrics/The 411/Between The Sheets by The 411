What was wrong with you?
What was wrong with me?
We can put it all behind
When we get between the sheets, babe

Looking down at your face
You know what i'm asking for
Soft and warm, in my place
Is it too much to ask for more

[Chorus]
What was wrong with you
What was wrong with me
We can put it all behind
When we get between the sheets, babe
What i said to you
What you said to me
We can put it all behind
When we get between the sheets, babe

Your sweet lips close to mine
I think it's time to come inside
Now here's your coat to catch the rain, baby
Don't stop until i go insane

[Repeat Chorus]
You don't understand what you do to me each time we kiss
I don't think another love will ever come close to this
Let me breathe the words and make you feel a certain way tonight
Everything you say or do, baby if it's wrong it's right

[Repeat Chorus x2]
