Seen her on the streets
Selling her body just to make ends meet
Everyday is the same sad story
She prays but no one answers back
Her soul never had a chance
Don't you laugh at her misfortune
Anyone can take a fall
If you were walking in those footsteps
You wouldn't laugh at all

[Chorus]
What if it was you standing on the street
What if it was you without enough to eat
What if it was you with nothing else to lose
What if it was you standing in those shoes
What if it was you all alone out there
Didn't have a choice, didn't a prayer
What if it was you down on your luck
What if it was you and no one gave a fuck

He's there everyday
Asking hey Mister can you spare some change
Why don't you get a job
Is all they say
You live with no such thing as pride
You're fighting just to stay alive
Don't you laugh as his misfortune
Anyone could take his place
If you were walking in those footsteps
Would you feel the same

[Repeat Chorus]
What if everyday you woke up without knowin' how you gon' eat
Where you gon' sleep
What if hard times hit you
Woudl you be so quick to judge another
Judge your brother
Or would you feel how it would be in their shoes
Don't you laugh at her misfortune
Anyone can take a fall
If you were walking in those footsteps
You wouldn't laugh at all

[Repeat Chorus]
