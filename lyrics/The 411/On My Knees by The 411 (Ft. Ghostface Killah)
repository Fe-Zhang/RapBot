[Hook]
I can't fall down on my knees
And apoligize to you, cause that ain't my style

[Verse 1]
I remember how we met, it was on the train, how could I forget?
You smiled and you looked at me, the soft of your lips, that captured me
The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other
And then we sat, down together
You gave me your number, said "give me a call"
I thought I wouldn't call at all
Here we are, fell in love
Like hand to glove, pure bliss from above
Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight
We never seem to get it right

[Hook]
I can't fall down on my knees
And apoligize to you, cause that ain't my style
I can't fall down on my knees
And apoligize to you, cause that ain't my style

[The 411]
I remember the night, when we were home alone
You were on the sofa, I was on the phone
You overheard me call out my best friend's name
That's when you went crazy, started going insane
Grabbed the phone from my hand, backed me against the wall
Shouting and asking, who was on the call?
You wouldn't believe me, when I said it's just a friend
That's when all the madness began....

[Hook 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Hook: The 411]
He's got you begging on your knees, crying in your sleep
Making you believe him, but you're stronger
Than you'll ever know, girl
You control your own world, no need to take no more

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I asked you to calm down
Asked you, who was on the phone, put the horn down
You had a glass of wine, a Versace nightgown, the lime green one
That I brought you for your tip, from the cruise you won
I don't approve of those male friends (no)
I told you back then when we first got together, I don't trust those men
And you did it again, I lost my temper
Blanked out and wrecked the house, boo, that's all I remember
I'm sorry...

[Hook]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
You know, I'm sorry
I didn't mean to put my hands on you like that
You know I got a bad temper, I had..
I must of had a bad day or something, boo
But, just come back to the crib...
