[Spoken]
(I know 'bout your girlfriend)
(I found out from her friend)
(There's no point denying)
(Cos i don't wanna talk about it)

Should've known you were too good to be true
Should've known there's no way i could trust you
The times when we were apart
You were lying and cheating and breaking my heart
Looking back now i feel so damn naÂ¯ve
Spreading lies that you knew i would believe
Like times when you used to say that you couldn't come home because you're working late

[Bridge]
When you're with me
I don't know what you tell your girlfriend
Boy, she must be so stupid
To believe that she's the only one
And all i know
Is that you're little game is over
I'm regretting the day that you first walked away
Can't even say that its been nice to know ya

[Chorus]
I know 'bout your girlfriend
I found out from her friend
Don't try to pretend
Cos i don't wanna talk about it
I know you've been lying
No point denying
But boy, i'm done crying
And i don't wanna talk about it

Remember boy, when you used to say
That you'd never take your love away
I just can't believe that you had the audacity to be creepin' on me
Sleeping round while you leave me here alone
When i call i just get your answer phone
Something is going on
Cos it's six in the morning and you still ain't home

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus to Fade]
