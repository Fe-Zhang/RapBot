(Till the end...)
(Till the end...)

My friend Kelly's got a problem in her life
She's got a man who doesn't love her
And never treats her right
No he hits her and he beats her
And nearly took her life
And now she's lying in a hospital bed
And all i can do is cry

She was my friend, till the end
There's no one better than her
She was always there, till the end
There was no need to apologize
She never did nothing to me
She was my friend (till the end)

My friend Jamie, he'd never had a fight
He was the sweetest kinda guy
He could always make me smile
Then he caught the street life
And he started selling drugs
Then they found him in a puddle
And it was no love

He was my friend, till the end
There's no one better than him
He was always there, till the end
There was no need to apologize
He never did nothing to me
He was my friend (till the end)

You gotta love yourself, hold yourself
Squeeze yourself, kiss yourself
And never let nobody else come disrespect yourself
Life is short and life is good
And life is sweet
But you never know when life will come and puch you off your feet
You only get one chance, you gotta take it
If you believe in you, you're gonna make it
Whenever things go wrong, only you can make it right
Don't ever let no one, no one control your life

He was my friend, till the end
There's no one better than him
He was always there, till the end
There was no need to apologize
She never did nothing to me
She was my friend (till the end)
He was my friend
She was my friend
Till the end...
Till the end...
Till the end...
