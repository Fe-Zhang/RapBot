Her eyes they glisten in the sun
As she watches the day become (night)
As the dark draws in
And then she takes a flute and plays a song
Melodies from days that have gone (by)

And as she looks in the water
He's smiling back at her
And in her heart she knows
The time is close
For her soul to move on from this earth

[Chorus]
It's been a loooooong time waiting
To see his face and
To feel his love again
Nooooooo more crying
Soon you'll be flying
To a place where forever begins

Flying to forever, forever
To a place where forever begins
Flying to forever, forever
To a place where forever begins

She remembers a time when he was there
They were blissfully unaware
That their time was near
For the man that she loved was to go away
He'd been called to a better place
Far...far away from here

And as she looks in the water
He's smiling back at her
And in her heart she knows
Her eyes they show
The dreams of the way things once were

[Repeat Chorus]
Two lovers pray
They'll meet again
On the other side
She feels no pain
She's strong again
Where the angels fly

And as she looks in the water
He's smiling back at her
And in her heart she knows
Her eyes they show
The dreams of the way things once were

[Repeat Chorus]
Flying to forever, forever
To a place where forever begins
Flying to forever, forever
To a place where forever begins
