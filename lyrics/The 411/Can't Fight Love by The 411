See i'm the one that loves you
She never deserved you
Sorry if it hurts her
But i've gotta have you
This might end a friendship
A chance i'm gonna take it
If you feel the same way i know that we can make it

Would she take your coat when you come in from out the rain?
Would she hold your hand again
If it eased away your pain
Would she try her best to give you room to grow
Or would it all be just a show
Or could it all just be in vain

[Chorus]
You can't fight love
No you can't fight love
Don't you turn and walk away
Cos i though i heard you say
You lost it time and time again
You can't fight love
No you can't fight love
You can't buy it on a shelf
You should look for no one else
Nobody but myself

I've been standing by
In a silence i have cried
Darling to hold you in the night
But i never spoke a word
And all the love in me
Can't reveal the way i feel
But when i tell you what's inside
Don't you run away for miles

[Repeat Chorus]
See i'm the one that loves you
She never deserved you
Sorry if it hurts her
But i've gotta have you
This might end a friendship
A chance i'm gonna take it
If you feel the same way i know that we can make it

[Repeat Chorus]
You can't fight love
