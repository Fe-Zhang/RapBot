Verse 1 - Carolyn
Too many times you crossed the line
Don't you come crawling back to me
Sayin' we can be friends
It's not the end
Trying to fix it with sorry
You cheated you lied you made me cry
Left me alone with no affection
Now look at you broke I hope you choke
On all your tears and all your tension

Group - Suzie sings lead
He'll take your heart
(He'll take your heart, he'll take your heart)
Destroy each and every part
(Each and every part)
Leave you cold laying in the dark
Cause he's dangerous (Ooh)
That man he's dangerous (Ooh)

Chorus - Group
Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one
To see you hurt to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times
You walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free

Verse 2 - Tisha
You seem to bring the pain
No more to gain
I'm out this situation
You were the rock to hold me down
You were the cause of my frustration
Now I see you cry you wipe your eyes
You promised me you've changed
But in the end you're still the same
How can a player change his game?

Group - Suzie sings lead
He'll take your heart
(He'll take your heart, he'll take your heart)
Destroy each and every part
(Each and every part)
Leave you cold laying in the dark
Cause he's dangerous (Ooh)
And then he's dangerous (Ooh)

Chorus - Group
Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one
To see you hurt to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free

Middle 8 - Tanya
He's in your mind
He's a shadow in the night
In his eyes there is no light
Cause he's dangerous
That man he's dangerous

Chorus - Group
Teardrops come again
I can almost feel your pain
I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one
To see you hurt to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times
You walked on me
Your teardrops came to set me free
