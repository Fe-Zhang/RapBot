Kool G Rap: Bloodshed, I painted the town red  (8X)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you're fuckin' with a well known felon
I'll do more then just leave you swellin'
I'll blast you in your melon and leave you smellin'
Take off the safety, insert the clip
Then I start to flip, bust off like dicks inside porno flicks
Up under my tongue is where my blade rest
My 12 gauge stress is even more scarier then a AIDS test
You know my steelo, I stay on the D-low
Murdering negros, with double four desert eagles
The juice from my cerebral, is lethal
Bloodshed outta be illegal, Evel like Knieval
Cause I get physical like a contact sport
I'm nasty like a crackhead in spandex shorts
All sorts of niggas dream about taking mines
But if they do they get their faces stitched up just like Frankenstein
Don't cross the line if you afraid of the gauge
I smell your pussy see the bitch running down your leg
Nigga

[Talking]
Yo let this niggas know
'95 we paintin' the whole fucking town red
These bitch ass niggas been saying you can't go solo
Let these niggas know what time it is
Take it to their fucking faces kid

[Verse 2]
I got a bullet vest, niggas that fes'
I'm on some new stress, walk around with a Smith Wess'
Giving heart tests, I'm heartless
On some ill shit, I'm out to spark shit
You wanna stay alive then money don't get on my spark list
Straight up Blood's a murderer who don't play, I fucking slay
Fuck around and get your brains blown like JFK
Richard Kuklinski that's my idol, all about survival
My gat leaves niggas more holy then the fucking Bible
But aiiyo it gets worse, I spark at church
I'm the type to make your grandmoms grab her fucking purse
My life is fucked up, worse-r then that, my life's a stressed world
Yo, even the fresh girls get sprayed up like S-curls
Assassin-ater brought up by the ways of a tec
A nine, a gat, a Glock is all I need to catch wreck
Bloodshed; a buddha head, known for flippin' when I'm trippin'
I put the fuckin' clip in then I'm leaving niggas drippin'
A madman, public nuisance, I'm like a heart threat
Leave niggas slain on the train like Bernhard Goetz
A murderer fucking with me, you must got problems
I'll make you wish your pops would've used a fucking condom, kid
Eyes are chinky like an oriental, far from gentle
I guess I'm just fucked up in the mental
Leavin' bullet scars, fuck usin' a knife
Buck ya twice, take your life plus your afterlife

[Verse 3]
Yo, murder astrologists, peep the final analysis
Thicker then mud, dealing with Blood, like dialysis
Cause Bloodshed is the opposite of painless
I'll rip your anus out the fuckin' frame with what ya came with
In a hurry, word to Keith Murray, "I Get In Ya"
And if you don't know let me tell you what I can bring ya
Press your heart, get the 44. out of my dresser drawer
Under my draws, next to nude photos of that Vanessa whore
You can't stop me, I got the force to floor Rocky
And then I'll rip his face off just like an autopsy
Nuff said, Bloodshed, the man who be tearing it
Evil like Medusa on her period, chewin' emcees like spearmint
Don't get caught cause I'm a stone short of pyramid
Wicked like witchcraft experiments
How could you think that you could beat me?
Think you could defeat me?
Malcolm X would eat pork before you eat me
