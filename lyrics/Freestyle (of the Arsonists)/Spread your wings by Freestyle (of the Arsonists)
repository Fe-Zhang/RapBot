-Intro-

It's days like this
When the clouds let down
We all wonder why
And there's no explanation
No explanation at all...

-Verse 1-

A day of tragedy
Can it be why the sky cries
I can't imagine or fathom the vision through your eyes
Within my veins it's rushin', I'm endurin' your pain
Thoughts streamin' from my brain, I'm collectin' your rain
Hearin' the fallen voices
They're speakin' from my heart
It's just a start, I'm a medium
Playin' his part
Playin' this harpsichord
Beyond my heart's accord
No way to replace
Erase what your hearts record
Spread your wings
It's all a matter of time as you climb to the heavens
We listen to this rhyme
With you in mind we're all standin' in life's line
Randomly numbers are called just waitin' for the sign
And suddenly I'm there
No turnin' back
I cherish every moment, no regrets
You hear it in my tracks
But this one's for you, for whatever it's worth
Keep a close eye as you hover over the earth, now...

-Chorus-

Spread your wings
And lead the way, I'll follow one day
We're all destined for the runway
As you know some say
The only guarantee in life is death
No explainin', just let the song play
Spread your wings
And lead the way, I'll follow one day
We're all destined for the runway
As you know some say
The only guarantee in life is death
But these people just left the wrong way

-Verse 2-

The day after...
Math, I couldn't add it up
Couldn't remember anything that made me mad enough
Or sad enough
Mother Nature havin' no remorse
Ain't tryin' to hear about nature taken its own course
Mother please I plead
No need to make the planet bleed any further
It's like murder movin' at Godspeed
We beg of you to be lenient with your discipline
The innocent payin' dearly for the sins of men
I personally apologize
The recent atrocities
Probably have you steamin' with animosity
Some deserve the punishment and some don't have a clue
I quote your words, "They know not what they do."
And suddenly we're there
No turnin' back
I cherish every moment, no regrets
You hear it in my tracks
But this one's for you, for whatever it's worth
Keep a close eye as your lookin' over the earth, now...

-Chorus 2x-
