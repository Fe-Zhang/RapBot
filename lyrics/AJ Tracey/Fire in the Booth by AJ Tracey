[Verse 1: AJ Tracey]
Yo, listen, look
What does MTP stand for?
It stands for mind your damn business
Kill off the scene, bare man are on my hitlist
Any man tryna watch man, that's a witness
Cock back .44, kill off the witness
Gym don't work against guns
It's not fun
I don't fear nobodies fitness
I got a don with a strap near Ipswich
I put grime back into that grime
I spit about what I want and what I like
And I'm born to trap
Trap on the bus, trap in a car
On a quadbike, or a trike
Like Chimz said I got a young 'ting and she's on 'tings
Body bom 'ting with a tongue ring
Probably have my food up in her Louis if I asked her
And probably take that food to a brudda if her don rings
AJ T fam I move like Sasuke
I keep pulling down weights like back day
Yats mac Trace' but they didn’t wanna mac Ché
Ops chatty but I'm soon gonna catch day
And ops chatting but I'm still gonna catch them
Get a riddim and I start spitting like a Mac 10
Not with the women that was chilling in the crack den
I put a pack down then a pack went
Did you hear AJ got shanked?
Did you hear AJ don't write his own bars?
Have you heard my man? He's wack
He spits the same flow every time he does a track
Half white, but he acts so black
He can't be active because his hair's in curls
And he's stush because he don't follow back
I heard he's got a small dick and he's never in the trap
Well, I never got shanked, I do the shanking
I write other man's bars and I get the thanks in
I'm wack? PRS says otherwise
Off of performances, man have got banks in
I'm not black or white, I'm both
And I've got curls, and I just do and that's life
I don't follow back 'cause you're wet
And girls hold my chest because they can't take the whole of the pipe
That's facts
PK's back and he's got a black Mac
And you know say that he's gonna tap that Mac
MC's chat about man get splashed
Pull up on the set and let the skeng throw crashed
You could be a grime older in the scene if you're talking of madness skengs forget crash
Treat the pussy like the decks man pulling on
If it gets mad I'm pulling that back
Mia Malkova—if you know what I'm on about, you're a loner
High-level bars, high level like stoner
Lightweight guys can't drink a Corona
Nah, one Corona they're drunk
On one, man's spinning around all slumped
These lightweights they can never get pumped
I'm too light skin, I could never get dumped
Stop chatting 'cause we got that pump
Bruddas are bound to get dumped
Pile up bodies all over that drum
Hear what I said, I ain't speaking in tongues
He's not real nah, he's an actor
Took man's chick with the winning factor
Done one line and that's still my style
'Cause the hood girls strong like Cleopatra

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey]
White girl, Angelina Jolie
Sitting in the car, my 'dargies blow weed
Start with a Q, then dance the Oz
Peng 'ting off the 'ish she banged the whole G
Nah, nah, nah, can't step to my team
Trinidad boy that's TNT
I've seen a real skengman sitting on a porch
Shotgun and White T
It ain't nothing for a nigga to holla my uncle
Tell him come down with an OG
When I say OG, I don't mean Jendor or Ruger or Little D, Blacks or P
I mean the buck shot with a gats in his jeans that will fly too quick
Gats in his jeans
Call up the squad, MTP, and tell them 'bout beef, family, it's peak

[Refrain: Charlie Sloth & AJ Tracey]
Oi, man like AJ, though, ay!
Just getting started, trust me, trust me
Yeah, run the next for me, Charlie
Alright, let's go straight in, fam

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey]
Yeah, something different for them
Classic riddims, you feel me?
Hm, let me give them some realness
Yo'
Look, they said AJ couldn't make it
My teachers said I couldn't make it
My year group said I couldn't make it
My old fam said I couldn't make it
Did the 1Xtra, rah is he gonna make it?
100k, Naila, is he gonna make it?
Grabbed the blue tick, rah is he gonna make it?
Linked with Mr Sloth rah is he gonna make it?
Jumped off the roads 'cause my Mum couldn't take it
Your chain man, couldn't say I couldn't take it
I get booked all over the world
And my PRS shits on your Mum and Dad's pay slips
I rep West, came in the game for the title
And trust me darg I'm gonna take it
That lock holding me down, I'm gonna break it
A stigma, just 'cause I'm brown, I'm gonna shake it
See I got a lot of negative bars 'cause I lived it
But see the violence? Man hate it
I don't want to do no damage, I want vibes
But irk one of my guys my brudda, I'll take it
Take it there like LD
Came to the game alone with no help, b
Learned that I should never watch, no face
So I only wanna look at myself just like selfies
Like Zuu I want my family healthy
Team wealthy and my movement stealthy
I got links in the South, in the Brick town
But you know I'm reppin the Western like LB
Wait, reppin' the Western like Haile
Came through shots in the game just like Spike Lee
You can't sleep on me, I'm like petrol
Full of Red Bull, the riddims they ignite me
They're like, AJ he's a right G
Told the Queen 'cause of my flow to come knight me
Joker, me don't want box so don't fight b
Double nine to the four I rep nineties
Wait, but I don't wear no Max 90's, 98's
95's, Air 1's, studio give me the instru', I'll tear one
Big man, hand me the mic and I'll air one
Rick Ross girls, might pair one
Next one in the bed and we'll share one
Came through all in the scene I shine bright
MC's look at me go, I might flair one
Hulk Hogan, you're Ric Flair
I was, cruising now I switch gears
See them nose covered in pink
My brothers made bare E, well E
Write but never eat rare grand mixer
Mixer, said just 'low all the beef
Your flows tight, my delivery's clear
I could make money, it's cool I'm gonna go clear
If I beef nigga, then dons my energy's shared
It is not that, saw Moncler I wanted so I copped that
Bare man are in it for themselves and I clocked that
Them man are out there holding felines for their bredrin's bars
Dem man are all top cats
My boy Frenchie is hooked on the poison
But he ain't even worried about nothin'
Man I popped that
I like my liquor with a kick like Ong-Bak
Bad bitch using bare teeth, told her stop that
And in the music biz, I'm new to this
Lifestyle's Ludacris
Got my cousin in the US with the smoothest whip
And if my hood gets bait, I'ma move to his
I grab papers, but I don't do the quiz
I got bruddas that can boom your wig
I'm out here in the booth it's sick
I used to chill in the flats just fiends, just spoons and shit
My mum used to grind for my school shoes
Now I just step in exclusive kicks
I tried out a ting on a student ting
But I'm a music kid and I'm new to this

[Bridge: AJ Tracey]
Feel me?
Last one, we got one more for them man

[Drake - Summer Sixteen]

[Verse 3: AJ Tracey]
See I came too hard
Pendant bright like the top of the shard
Came to the club with a couple bags cash
If I spend it then I'm gonna swipe my card
Foreplay niggas tryna bite man hard
Allow it, I'm just tryna buy my yard
Couple fast cars with a place in the sun
And a home cinema I can hide my marge
But I'm having visions and I'm overly charged
Whole gang waved like the water in Prague
Left hand on a full bottle of Courvoss
And my right hand's chilling on a peng 'ting's arse
PSG tracksuit cos' I got class
Tell them fiends they can save P's if they grab big bits
Come and grab a Z or a half
My grip tight, loose grip on the glass
El Shaarawy man skip, then blast
Don't even smoke but when the Am lands
I'ma puff, then pass
Got a grey yute that will lift his clart
No smoke then I let the pokies start
I'm really on call
Got T's like Uniqlo, green like Yoshi's car
AJ T, I'm bosey boss
I remember my nan said I was too loud
Now she says that I'm way too fast
Fast with the girls and I'm fast in the dance
Shutdown shows like Windows
Then I get paid in doss
AJ from the lane, man have got wha-?
AJ from the lane, man have got bars
No license still cranked in the car
Big hand 'tings, fam no shanks in the car
Now I'm in the back of the rave
Gyaldem tryna get a glance of my face
Tapping mates like I swear that's AJ from the Lane
How we gonna get a quick pic for the Insta
His team's looking like Inter
Fly like the wings on a plane
What they say so clear like the bling on the chain
She was buff on the Insta
What a shame she's a sham so I'm gonna make her sing for the pain, it's bubbly
Brudda I'm an Ace of the Spades
King of the Lane and a Prince of the game
Money over everything
I get to smoke weight
Do you get me? It's crystal clear what I say
Got a model from a magazine
Little sticker, whines too much but I'm never gonna lick her
I ain't drunk in love and I'm never gonna lick her
'Cause I got bare girls tyrna jump at the nigga
One love if you shouted
When I was jugging one love if you shouted
I always knew I had the gift of the gab
So I got my stack right I put my money where my mouth is
