[Chorus]
Chillin' in Cuba, me and a diva
She got that water, she know I need her
I'm cuttin' up cod or a tuna
Me, I'm a lover, but bro, you're a loser
I love a pretty Latina (ayy)
I love a pretty Latina (ayy)
Make her step out with the Nina (ayy)
I love a pretty Latina (ooh)
Chillin' in Cuba, me and a diva
She got that water, she know I need her
I'm cuttin' up cod or a tuna
Me, I'm a lover, but bro, you're a loser
I love a pretty Latina (ayy)
I love a pretty Latina (ayy)
Make her step out with the Nina (ayy)
I love a pretty Latina (ooh)

[Verse 1]
Every time I step up in the place (every time)
Girls are tryna get up in my face (like what?)
Like "Oh my God it's AJ Trace! (oh my God)
Baby boy, I wanna be your mate" (yeah)
I... made a milli', then I did the race (vroom)
I went to the Hills from the base (to the Hills)
I've been sippin' Henny by the case (Henny)
I put VVS' in the face (bling blaow)
I'm hittin' them cheeks from the back (oh)
I got the sack (yeah), it's the return of the mack (who?)
Summertime, I'm on the block in all white (Grove)
Wintertime, I'm in the grove in all black (Grove)
Niggas talk down and they're holdin' a slap
I'm in Toronto, the strap in the back (6)
Rollin' with Poet and Safe, issa wrap
Duckin' the pigs, it's halal on the map (ah)

[Chorus]
Chillin' in Cuba, me and a diva
She got that water, she know I need her

[Verse 2]
I'm in Holland gettin' turnt (Holland)

Breakin' it down, choppin' the flow

She came for dick, she ain't here for a rose (ooh)
Ice on my neck, it's so hot that it glows (bling blaow)

Run a nigga down for the mandem (what?)
I said run a nigga down broad day for the bros

[Chorus]
Chillin' in Cuba, me and a diva
