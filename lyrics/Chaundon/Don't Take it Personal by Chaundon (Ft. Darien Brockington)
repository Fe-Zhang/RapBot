[Hook] [Darien Brockington]
Don't keep hatin' on me
Cause you can't do it better than me
You heard it first out there in the streets
I got this game on lock down
Don't take it personal
Don't keep hatin' on me
Cause you can't do it better than me
I'm the V.I.P. in the streets
I got this game on lock down
Don't take it personal

[Verse One]
I understand all the hatred
Take it out on me, cause I'm the main reason you ain't make it
I see the opportunity and take it
Like after rockin' a show, your girl is in my dressing room naked
My fault for puttin' in work
I went to school, paid dues, so today I wouldn't have to get jerked
I know it's rough, cause I'm all in your way
I'm writin' rhymes all the time instead of gettin' drunk and high all day
I'm sorry
What you want me to do?
Half step, put on a poor performance and wind up just like you?
Another hopeless MC who can't get up off the corner
Rap about ace of spades, still sippin' quarter waters?
Naw brother, no can do, I apologize
My bank account is increasin' my wallet size
And I don't fantasize about being a millionaire
Reality shows I'm on my way there

[Hook] [Darien Brockington]
Don't keep hatin' on me
Cause you
Can't do it better than me
You heard it first out there in the
Streets
I got this game on lock down
Don't take it personal
Don't keep hatin' on me
Cause you can't do it better than me
I'm the V.I.P. in the streets
I got this game on lock down
Don't take it personal

[Verse Two]
I paused and took notes
Watched the mistakes y'all made
Learned from 'em
Be damned if I don't get paid
Kept creatin'
Didn't pay mind to the hatin'
Fools too quick to talk, they speed racin'
I just took my time and moved silent
The game got cold, I came and changed the climate
Grabbed onto the ladder of success, kept climbin'
Forced y'all to step down without gettin' violent
But make no mistake about my friendly demeanor
I'm God's left hand, my wrath's a bit meaner
When I'm done here, they got to call in the cleaner
The carnage alone will have you wish you'se a heater
Torture
Hell's flame can't match the scorcher
You're a Hyundai goin' up against a Porsche
Stay in your lane or get ran off the road
I warned you, so I don't wanna hear you didn't know

[Hook] [Darien Brockington]
Don't keep hatin' on me
Cause you
Can't do it better than me
You heard it first out there in the
Streets
I got this game on lock down
Don't take it personal
Don't keep hatin' on me
Cause you can't do it better than me
I'm the V.I.P. in the streets
I got this game on lock down
Don't take it personal
