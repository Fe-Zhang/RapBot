3H, this should be the commercial right here

[Hook]
As soon as the Goons hit the building you know the boys
My team hit the spot and they get hot like coal [??]
Bump J, [??] and Sly Polaroid
We don’t play no games
Check out the ride, then
Come check out the diamonds
The paper’s in my nature
Player status they shinin’
Get out the way when I drive the lane
Cause we don’t play no games

[Verse 1]
From the tip-off, til the last basket scored
I’mma get big, penetrate, and crash the boards
I shoot, I barely miss
If I put in in the air, bet all you hear is swish
You could double-team, go on, put your D on high pressure
Still take off or pull up for the trifecta
I got your defense so shook
They don’t know if I’mma dunk, pull up for the J, or throw a no look
Think I’m jokin’ then find out
I just went on a 10-0 run, you besta call a timeout
All the fans in the building might stare, when I do this new move and juke you out your gym shoes
If he ever play ya
You gon’ think I cheated, got a team full of created players
I’m a hustler, just give me the ball, it’s on
I shake you out that [??], shoot you out the dome

[Hook]

[Bridge]
He’s been thinkin’, he’s been hopin’
He can guard Bumpy Johnson, but he’s open
Better double team him
Watch the coach, cuz if I hit Sly on the post then it’s over

[Verse 2]
We can play one-on-one
I don’t know who gassed you
I got a deadly first step, I’ll blow right past you
On defense, I get them hands
And on offense, I got handles like pots and pans
Get some game, you ain’t got you any
You couldn’t win if I picked the worst team and spot you 20
I can’t stop, I’m on a roll
And I’m nuts at home
But I put up numbers on the road
Get the rock, you won’t get a shot
You shoot, shoot fast
I put em on the glass like Mix-a-Lot
I get …
I got a six man, that could shoot it from half court

[Hook]

Yeah… game over … rookie of the year
Bump J … pass me the rock
