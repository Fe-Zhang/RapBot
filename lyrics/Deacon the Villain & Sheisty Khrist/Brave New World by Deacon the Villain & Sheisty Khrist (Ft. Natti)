Hook [Deacon]

It's a brave new world X 6
Are you ready for this?
Are we moving to fast
It's a brave new world
And for that it may last

First Verse [Natti]

The system's dosage of pop, rock and soda pop
And urban legend with high voltage from culture shock
From nation's led by the same habits that vultures got
We need leaders (liters) like alcoholics with stomach rot
Tomorrow's John Conner ain't watching Harry Potter
He's in the hallows of the ghetto training Rottweilers
Or washing dishes at frishes for next-to-no dollars
Cause you ain't solving delimmas if you don't know problems
This was the home of the brave before the pilgrams came
Now it's the land of the free and we pay for everything
That's why I blow trees, rolled in old leaves
And drive through neighborhoods nicer than mine at low speeds
I been at Coolie High ever since they killed Cochise
Boppin' my music at levels that shake the concrete
So there'll be no peace and there'll be no sleep
So wake the fuck up I'll show you the world that I see

Abbreviated Hook

Second Verse [Sheisty]

Our leaders elitist black and white like a zebra
We need to see the black and white like Adidas
A cheetas hunger the real meaning of jungle fever
We siege in thunder the real meaning of under Caesar
Fuck a season move a legion in the cold of winter
My soul's like a cold avenger with a frozen center
Night Ops a nigga sleeping when the Trojan enter
Cyclops the way we creep in like a Gojin ninja
We fight the power like P.E. We fight the powers like BP
Some fight the power to be free
Fuck a political party, nigga, this anarchy
You plan to harm me watch me land with a land army
These niggas throwing hand grenades and hope they land on me
These motherfuckers so afraid they keep a cam on me
And they watch the way I move so they can scam on me
Pull me over pat me down and put a gram on me
And I ain't talking a Grammy nigga, I'm talking soft white - Orphan Annie nigga
In other words The Man is watching what you hand me, nigga
So if I just keep walking, understand me nigga
