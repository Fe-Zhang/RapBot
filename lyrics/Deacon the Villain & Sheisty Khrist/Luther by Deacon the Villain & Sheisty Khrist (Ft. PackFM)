Hook:

Luther X 3
Martin Luther Jr. KANG!

First Verse [PackFM]

Let me start from the beginning at the top of the set
If it ain't February then you might forget
For some our struggle was a fight to the death
That's why I'm far from civil with these rights and lefts
I'm similar to segregation, I got a dark side
When it shows, niggas split just like apartheid
Outsiders wanna know, just how far I'll go
To lift up the hood like the engine in my car died
*Get yo' hand out my pocket!* or draw back a stump
Rowdy niggas stay in the back of the bus
Lookin out my window with my hand on a pump
Sawed off shotgun, raw dog, you not one
I haul off and pop one *RUN!* shots fired
My squad's Million Man March mixed with Watts Riots
Outlandish shit you never heard before
Like Black Panthers pumping their fists on Jersey Shore
We stand out like a protest with our leaders
You had a dream thinking ignorance could defeat us
It takes a lot more than a t-shirt to free us
So I stand behind these bars for life like Mumia

Hook

Is ignorance bliss or is ignorance a bitch? X2
Is ignorance bliss? is ignorance bliss?
Is ignorance bliss or is ignorance a bitch?

Second Verse [Deacon]

Snap shots, deac's Gordan Parks with a Canon
And I fly over haters, on my Tuskeegee Airmen
You can bring chains, bring liquor, bring famine
You'll never bring a nigga down, you could bring Samson
Chairmen of the board, you the chairmen of the Borg
And I'm coming before pharoah, with just Aaron and the Lord
Carrying my sword, I'm Harriet in a chariot
Coming with the power of infinite Secretariats
The scariest slave, I'm Nat Turner in the booth
I'm Denzel in glory with black burners and troops
The Soujourner Truth and I'm here to put you underground
And I'm striking from the clouds where the thunder pounds
James Weldon Johnson from Compton
Stompin, while these minority chords haunt them
Hide under a cloth, I'm the fire on yo cross
And I'm burning until ignorance is mired in a loss, nigga!
