First Hook

Everybody looks
But nobody speaks
Everybody walks
But nobody stops
I'm going trough the streeets of our town
From the darkness ___________

First Verse [Deacon The Villain]

We no longer say hi, we just @ reply
Barren souls so dry they'd make a cactus die
I see it clearer than the mirror where we practice fly
And hide our sadness under the mattress where blackness hides
I'm talkin' dark, darker than closets full of skeletons
We hide underneath a cloak of elegance
But what do I know, sweet chariot please swing low
And when the angels finally get here tell em we need mo
Before we all faced up watching wild seeds grow
I feel the fire raging down below, feel the burn
Dreams turned to ash, you could fill an urn
It's an emergency that we don't feel concerned
Can't nobody climb this mountain alone
But since your neighbors ain't allowed in ya home
We sit inside and face these battles alone
I'm thinkin' maybe we got it wrong, Lord!

I'm going to a brand new world
A world where people can live
A world where people can speak
A world ________

Second Verse [Sheisty]

This nigga asked me my name
But i pretended not to hear him as we passed in the rain
Our movements like light beams fast as a train
Or two ships in the night from a passenger train
Call me invisible man
Like when niggas from Sudan stand on Israel's land
My thoughts so vivid you would think I use a visual cam
But in truth all I use is my hand
And a hand is a weapon of war or peace
I'm a horrible beast unleashed at war with Greece
Or the beast with teeth released to explore beneath
The coral reef where Leif's explorers thiefed
And there is no power greater than speech
In fact, each who refuses to teach should be labeled a leech
Thoughts are rays of heat that glaze like a person laid on the beach
So niggas running like you playing in cleats
Nobody means none, noboby means not even one
Nobody means we're probably done
Where the earth will wither, that means the first shall disperse from hither
Including niggas that immersed in rivers
Including everyone the nurse delivers
That means the baby thats birthed that's nursed and shivers, or cursed and slithers
Its clear he with an ear must hear
Lest everything here disappear in less than a year
