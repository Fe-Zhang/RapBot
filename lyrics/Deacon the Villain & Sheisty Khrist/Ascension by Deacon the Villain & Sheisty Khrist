Reaching for the stars
I don’t care who you are
But don’t get caught up
Reaching for that cool

Sheisty

My teachers always told me I should reach for the stars
That if I reached far enough I’d reach a creature from mars
I kept reaching but the teachings wasn’t reaching my heart
I said fuck it started reaching for cars
To each his own some teachers teach us peace is shalom
While others teach us it’s a brougham with the pieces of chrome
Some of you dudes wear gold like tutenkamen
While other dudes wear clothes like a buddhist shaman
The way I drop jewels niggas is like this dude islamic
But I rock shoes in hues that make Judas vomit
See my aesthetic somewhere between Kemetic ascetic
And a dreaded heretic in a leather fitted
And if the weather permited it I might have weathered blizzards
I might have spitted where I rested but I never shitted
Some will dissect my shit some will never get it
Some will say I was clever others whatever with it
I’m like the nigga that meditated and levitated
Or like the nigga that’s medicated and never made it
Some bitches handed me the apple but I never ate it
My nodes control codes on which rap is predicated
We live this rap shit but y’all niggas fabricate it
Some niggas map the genome others navigate it
I’m in the labrynth on the sabbath with the staff of David
You’ll never find my name engraved on an affadavit
We ride in cars that hood niggas buy 20’s for
In fact fuck the minivan doors just give me 24’s
You know the types that get you whores you pour Henny for
And drink plenty more till there’s not any more
This is fair warning I’m like a bear snoring
While the hurricane’s forming and the rain’s pouring
I’m like a cancer in the brain that lays dormant
Y’all like answering to claims like paid informants
The closest that I’ll ever be to in the air soaring
Is the pair of wings on my rare air Jordans
Yall niggas is borin’

Most’ll never get to bat at the field dreams
Some people'll never see the sky, they in a guilliteen
Everybody lives to die, and the inbetween
Is duckin gorilla swings and facing the realer things
From a world full of soulless goals
I’ve seen children with eyes that were old as gold
To some the sky’s like the coldest joke
And if you reach for what’s high you might overdose
But through the blowin smoke, you gotta see this
Our hopes and our dreams concieved by the elitist
We fall for the traps, we rats, chasing cheese
With the straps, tats, crack and rap, we making g’z
All this confusion got us losin’ by a landslide
And got the biggest mothafuckaz feelin’ antsized
The disillusioned, the disenfranchised
Who wanna through the peace sign, but got they hands tied
Why ask why, that’s what they wanna teach us
They’d rather have us sit in the bleachers and wait for Jesus
But I believe He’d rather we doubt what leads us
Instead of praising what pleases, ascension
