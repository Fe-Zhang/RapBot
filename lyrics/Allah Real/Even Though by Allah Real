[Intro: Allah Real]
You know what, we been through a lotta stuff
Ain't nobody taught me, let me talk to about it
It's like this

[Allah Real]
Why, must we fight, I just deliver
Why... yeah... yeah... give up, no, no
You know what? You and me, just don't give up
We try......
Nobody's dying, from this and what
Even though, we giving up...
The pain... got you... it got you...
But I said... show you what's up
Tell you why we live our promise
If you said you loved me, you'd tell m
You won't be giving up
