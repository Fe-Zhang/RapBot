[Verse 2]
Dem ah tell me how dem cold

Nuff ah dem say dem cold like up ah the north pole
So dem shoot down the young, shoot down the old
Shoot down the puss an all the dog and the fole
Every weekend them tek a next payroll
Out of man pocket dem shoot out billfold
Dis Marcus Garvey nuff head haffi go roll
Look here now

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3]
Them think dem reach the ultimate
But dem nah reach nowhere yet
Dem get caught in a internet
And society ah tell dem dem ah intellect:
Dem promote too much death
Unno look here now

[Repeat Hook]

Marcus Garvey say:
Ten miles outta the city

[Hook]

Send me go trod down inna di east

Well life we ah promote fi mek de ghetto youth see't
Life you no fi breach
Watch here now

[Hook]
