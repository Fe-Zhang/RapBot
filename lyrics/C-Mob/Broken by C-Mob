[Chorus]
When you feel you're broken
When the ones you love have done you wrong
When you find out the ones you were loyal to, never had your back all along
When you feel you're broken
And no one knows your pain
That you know that they'll never understand all the things that are going on in your brain
When you feel you're broken
When you feel you're broken
When the ones you love have done you wrong
When you find out the ones you were loyal to, never had your back all along
When you feel you're broken
And no one knows your pain
That you know that they'll never understand all the things that are going on in your brain
When you feel you're broken

[Verse 1]
I feel like something's wrong with me
I just wanna disappear anywhere but here is where I long to be
In the dark laying on debris
From the wreckage of my sanity
Why can't I be a stronger me
But I'm falling to fragments, I'm fractured
Gotta rebuild this rubble before I mumble my last words
Maybe I'm just a bastard that's mastered fast words
Feeling captured, going backwards
Trying to ascertain how to have the pain from the past cured
It never ceases 'til all the pieces that cracked merge
Fighting Satan he knows he's been my captor
Now I'm after repose and verdant pastures
But I'm lost in the shadow of death
Feeling weak up a creek with no paddle and stressed
Out of finesse, wishing I was battling less
Mad at my mess, regrets, vexed sad and depressed
And I'm trapped in a panic induced state
Should I bother fixing myself, are the damages too great?
This planet just fuels hate, and dammit it's too late
To break from this depression, this manic it mutates
What do I do, I feel like I am hopeless
If mental health is wealth, I'm at my brokest
I need help, does anyone even notice?
I just try to focus

[Chorus]
When you feel you're broken
When the ones you love have done you wrong
When you find out the ones you were loyal to, never had your back all along
When you feel you're broken
And no one knows your pain
That you know that they'll never understand all the things that are going on in your brain
When you feel you're broken

[Verse 2]
What do I do now
I could pick up the pieces if I just knew how
Every time I look over me, there are new clouds
I don't handle it soberly I get too loud
Cause I'm drunk and I'm drinking until I'm shitfaced
It wakes up the emotions I try to displace
Which take me to a sick place of mistakes
This makes me feel a disgrace that Chris hates
My mind replays my violent days and I get crazed
Don't stop and hide, just walk on by like Isaac Hayes
I'm fighting rage, a heightened blaze, all night and day
I cannot escape my thoughts, I can't get out it's like a maze
So much anxiety, disconnect from society, fires inside of me growing higher
Why did they lie to me?
Friends I thought would ride with me, violently turned to rivalry
Sleighted me to a high degree, opposite of delight it be
Let people close, you just test your luck
What do you do after your best friend sets you up?
It'll mess you up, have you depressed as fuck
Now since you don't know who to trust, all the rest get cut
People will cross you if you give 'em a turn
And they'll come after your dividends earned
All with little concern
Fuck all the love that they didn't return....
I guess you live and you learn

[Chorus]
When you feel you're broken
When the ones you love have done you wrong
When you find out the ones you were loyal to, never had your back all along
When you feel you're broken
And no one knows your pain
That you know that they'll never understand all the things that are going on in your brain
When you feel you're broken
That you can't forgive yourself, for the things that you've done in the past
Now your thoughts are hazardous to your health
When you feel you're broken
Just know you're not alone
You can pick up the pieces and put yourself back together all on your own
When you feel you're broken

[Verse 3]
It's like I no longer know myself
I just look into the mirror and I loathe myself
Blows I've felt, when life hit below the belt
I've dealt with them with decisions that oppose my health
Whatever it takes in the moment to get me past
Pain and confusion so I usually get detached
Titties, ass, a whisky flask work pretty fast
When I simply smash for the succession then quickly crash
Now what do I do with this life
I'm trying be through with this strife
There's too much gloom in this and I really wanna be the luminous type
The transition from negative starts now
I gotta be positive sick of living in dark clouds
Trying to put together this broke and shattered mess
Neurosis at it's best, my most combative test
A host to manifest, Post Traumatic Stress
Get ghost, I am the one that you don't come at and flex
It's easy to spiral out of control
Especially with demons that are out for your soul
Misery's the only route that it goes
To you're the one for whom the bells about to be tolled
Even with the scars and with all the mistakes
And the toll on your soul, feels like all of it breaks
Sometimes you fall apart for things to fall into place
Just pick yourself up, that's all that it takes

[Chorus]
When you feel you're broken
When the ones you love have done you wrong
When you find out the ones you were loyal to, never had your back all along
When you feel you're broken
And no one knows your pain
That you know that they'll never understand all the things that are going on in your brain
When you feel you're broken
That you can't forgive yourself, for the things that you've done in the past
Now your thoughts are hazardous to your health
When you feel you're broken
Just know you're not alone
You can pick up the pieces and put yourself back together all on your own
When you feel you're broken
