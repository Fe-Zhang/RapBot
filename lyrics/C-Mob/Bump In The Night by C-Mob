[Verse 1: C-Mob]
I'm one of the things that go bump in the night
Creepin' up on your woman, lookin' for something to bite
And I'll jump in it right
When I get her up over my crib
Her desire I will apprehend, extreme pleasure and pain
It's what will happen when we make love
My taste buds will taste blood
When she wakes up, her grave's dug
The face of a monster will greet her with a scary surprise
Drink from me and live forever or get burried alive
Very deprived and hungry so at night I'm out mobbin'
Vampiric apetite, wicked like a goblin
Runnin' game so easy, you will think it's unjust
Using women to fullfil my blood lust

[Hook x2]
I'm a motherfucking monster, vampire, hop goblin
Better watch out, when I'm... mobbin'
Cause I go bump in the middle of the night
Bump, bump in the middle of the night

[Verse 2]
I'm a motherfucking monster, vampire, Nosferatu
Once you let me in, that's when I, know I got you
With my set of fangs, sever veins
I will never change, I'm forever strange and deranged
Wither plains, in the light if it's indirect
Night madness in effect, bite bitches in their neck
Might finish with the tec
Coverin' up the nature of the murder then I have to go
So they don't know that it was done by something supernatural
Luring these women to get into my chamber
Fucking her good until one of us came
Then after the pleasure she's gonna get pain
Cause I'mma go for the jugular vein
And nah bitch, I don't sparkle in the sunlight
Fuck with me and you'll get done right

[Hook x2]
I'm a motherfucking monster, vampire, hop goblin
Better watch out, when I'm... mobbin'
Cause I go bump in the middle of the night
Bump, bump in the middle of the night

[Bridge]
I rise out of my coffin, wake up and gone
I was fucking and fiendin' from dusk till dawn
You gotta watch out for the things that go bump in the night
Relationships never work so I don't search for love
Cause I got an unquenchable thirst for blood
Some live in the dark of the things they hide in the light

[Verse 3]
You see my plot thicken the very moment I got bitten
Cause my thoughts sicken the soft kitten, the clock's tickin'
Iâ€™m lock-picking these chastity belts and I'm not quittin'
And I got dick in these hot chick and her box strippin'
My cock spittin' in the spot hittin', I'm twat lickin'
And if you're trippin' get to rock kickin', because I need alot
I use my fangs when I eat the twat
Because I love to suck blood from the sweetest spot
And indeed it's hot, now which girls the baddest here
With the fattest rear, let me grab it dear
You don't have to fear, I will make my status clear
When the cat is near, and impale it like Vladimir

[Hook x2]
I'm a motherfucking monster, vampire, hop goblin
Better watch out, when I'm... mobbin'
Cause I go bump in the middle of the night
Bump, bump in the middle of the night
