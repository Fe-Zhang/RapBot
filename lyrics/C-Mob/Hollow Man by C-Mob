[Verse 1]
People think I show no love
Could it be that I have no love to give?
Every time I opened my heart to somebody in the past
All they did was shut the lid
And I’ve had enough of it
Emotions are dangerous like giving a drug to kids
So many people are dependent on love
Like a vampire needs blood to live
And they wonder why I show no emotion
You can wanna cry for so low you’re roasting
I can feel the high with no roller coasting
Part of me has died, let go, show’s devotion
I did away with all the feelings that reside within me and there were plenty
Now inside there’s nothing
The type of void that’ll make you wanna kill
And the only time I feel is when I’m fucking
I think I’ve lost my mind again, it’s idling
I maybe need a vitamin, some Niacin
I never need to cry again, I feel like the sad sound of a violin
'Cause I’ve decided in, letting all my feelings go
Now I’m no longer feeling low
But sometimes I feel like a sociopath
And I think I might be going into killing mode
I walk around with a blank stare
Hoes looking for love I can’t give it, it ain’t there
That’s attention I can’t spare, and I can’t care
If you think that it ain’t fair
I’m completely jaded (jaded)
And that shit swallows innocent lives
But I do not waddle, sit and then cry
I’m emotionally hollow on the inside

[Chorus]
You see I used to have nothing but love inside of me
But too many people stabbed me in the back and lied to me
I used to think that my loved ones would all be there for me
But now I choose who I let in my circle way more carefully
And now I’m jaded, it’s a miracle I made it
Every time I've tried to show love
All they show me back is hatred
This life does not treat me gently I’ve given it all I can
And now I’m completely empty call me the Hollow Man

[Verse 2]
If everything happens for a reason
Was I meant to be this way?
I don’t really see another option
Turning cold is the only way I live to see this day
I await, to higher rates, of lying snakes, who try and hate
So many people that I used to have love for
Ended up putting me in dire straits
And I elate, all of the fake friends, who take ends
Waiting and wonder when they will break in
Awaiting, for the day for you’ll finally cave in
They gathering behind your back and [?] debating
And hating, on you and plotting on making
Another move, guess Satan awakened
Within 'em, giving them a minimum of hesitation
They leave me aching, but the signs is vacant
'Cause I’ve forsaken, all of my emotions
No notions, to be living in anger
But it doesn’t mean you’re not in imminent danger
Hit em with changers, 'til it gets stranger
Dealing with an apathetic sociopath embedded
With the grind, focus on the cash and get it
Indebted to my own hollowness it gets massive credit

[Chorus]
You see I used to have nothing but love inside of me
But too many people stabbed me in the back and lied to me
I used to think that my loved ones would all be there for me
But now I choose who I let in my circle way more carefully
And now I’m jaded, it’s a miracle I made it
Every time I've tried to show love
All they show me back is hatred
This life does not treat me gently I’ve given it all I can
And now I’m completely empty call me the Hollow Man

[Verse 3]
People wanna keep acting
Like they wanna get up under my skin and get a reaction
Wanna see the heat blastin'
Tryna take me out of the game because I keep mashing
And rapping in elite fashion
So they try to find a way
They can get me to slip up and then give them the time of day
But I ignore all the games that they tryna play
I’ll never be a mindless pawn
I stay to myself anti social and withdrawn
And people keep giving me reasons not to fuck with them
And dammit the list long
It is what it is I really don’t give a fuck I’m indifferent
People think I’m an asshole because I don’t fuck with them
I don’t give a shit
End of discussion, don’t be mad 'cause I trust none
And not even just one
I don’t even trust my own dick when the lust comes
You’ve never seen so much substance
From someone who’s filled with a vacancy
Wait and see, they call me the Hollow man
But you’ll never be breaking me

[Chorus]
You see I used to have nothing but love inside of me
But too many people stabbed me in the back and lied to me
I used to think that my loved ones would all be there for me
But now I choose who I let in my circle way more carefully
And now I’m jaded, it’s a miracle I made it
Every time I've tried to show love
All they show me back is hatred
This life does not treat me gently I’ve given it all I can
And now I’m completely empty call me the Hollow Man
