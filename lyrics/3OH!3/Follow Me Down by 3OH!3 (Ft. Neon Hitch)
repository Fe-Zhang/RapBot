[Intro: Neon Hitch]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down

[Verse 1: Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Take me, take me
Outta here, it makes me
Feel so, feel so
Na—na—na-na—na
Baby, baby
Here we are all crazy
You don't have to worry
Na—na—na-na—na

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte (Neon Hitch)]
So follow me down (where to?)
Outta this town (with you)
Girl, you're movin' way too slow
So follow me down (which way?)
I'll show you around (okay)
There's a place we gotta go

[Chorus: Sean Foreman, Nathaniel Motte & Neon Hitch]
Follow me, follow me
Fa—la—la-la—la
Follow me, follow me
Fa—la—la-la—la
Hoe—wa—oh
Hoe—wa—oh
Hoe—wa—oh-oh
Fa—la—la-la—la

[Verse 2: Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Dancing, walking
Clock keeps on talking
They sing, they sing
Na—na—na-na—na
Gentlemen and ladies
Animals and babies
We sing, we sing
Na—na—na-na—na

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte (Neon Hitch)]
So follow me down (where to?)
Outta this town (with you)
Girl, you're movin' way too slow
So follow me down (which way?)
I'll show you around (okay)
There's a place we gotta go

[Chorus (Extended): Sean Foreman, Nathaniel Motte & Neon Hitch]
Follow me, follow me
Fa—la—la-la—la
Follow me, follow me
Fa—la—la-la—la
Hoe—wa—oh
