[Verse]
(Day one) A chapel and it’s glistening
(Day three) The sun is shining on a perfect beach
(Day six) A train, it isn’t whistling
(Day ten) And I don’t want to see you off again

[Chorus]
We know the most crunk indie
City-choking chimney sweepers
Turn up your radio
This song we play will blow the speakers
Don’t stop whistling
To let them know what they’ve been missing
Turn your jukebox on
This song we play will blow the system

[Outro]
No one’s been, no one’s been
The chariot that I’ve been
And it’s burning under my skin
Carrying, carrying
The lady back to her kin
That should be the first thing
No one’s been, no one’s been (oh...)
The carpenter that I’ve been
Building you this cabin
Burying, burying
Those heroes as they’re gasping
That should be the last thing
