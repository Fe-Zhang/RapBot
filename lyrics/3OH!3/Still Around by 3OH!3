[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
Go ahead and burn it down
I’m drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
They won’t let me turn around
To get one last look at my baby

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
Go ahead and build it up again
This city’s just cemeteries and
Forgotten men
My only hope’s to see you
And even if I never do

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around

[Bridge: Sean Foreman]
And I know what you’re thinking
That won’t stop this drinking
It’s the least I can do
‘Cause this life is anything but certain
When they close the final curtain
You’ll get a glimpse of the truth

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
‘Cause you’re still around
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around
Well, she’s still around

[Outro: Sean Foreman]
Go ahead and burn it down
I’m drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
