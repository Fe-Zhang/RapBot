[Verse 1]
Yeah I came into this world without a single idea
That if you wanna get to the top
Then you better learn how to steal
When everything is mine, do I really need apostrophe?
You better learn how to raise your hand if you wanna come here and talk to me
I rock a bus pass cause you know that talk is cheap
Can't make a living driving shit just like colostomy
Plus, these bitches ain't King Koopa boss of me
This shit is crunchy, like socks and Birkenstocks to me
Upset your neighbors when the music makes you stomp your feet
Upset the dead when we're in the graveyard dropping beats
Crack your head when we take you out and rock the street
Now everybody go ahead and sing along with me

[Chorus]
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
If our shit's so bad, why's your sister tryna fuck us?
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Saying, "Look at these bad ass stupid motherfuckers"
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
If our shit's so bad, why's your sister tryna fuck us?
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Saying, "Look at these bad ass stupid motherfuckers"

[Verse 2]
Wrapped in a Navajo poncho
With a beard soaked in patchouli to drip into your nachos
I can get your blood boiling like Al Pacino
Cause I'll be the one rapping in your ear
While you're waiting for your Frappuccino
Yeah, I get the crowd high like every word's a kilo
While Nat gets radiation, you're making beats just like it's chemo
We glow like mutant ooze that turns us into ninjas
It goes three drinks, peace out - just the middle fingers

[Chorus]
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
If our shit's so bad, why's your sister tryna fuck us?
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Saying, "Look at these bad ass stupid motherfuckers"
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
If our shit's so bad, why's your sister tryna fuck us?
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Saying, "Look at these bad ass stupid motherfuckers"

[Bridge]
Captain, two specimens, both native and foreign (foreign)
Belonging to their culture, yet answering to no one (no one)
Both tall and exceedingly handsome (handsome)
If I had to guess, I'd say they were wealthy and then some
(and then some)

[Chorus]
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
If our shit's so bad, why's your sister tryna fuck us?
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Saying, "Look at these bad ass stupid motherfuckers"
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
If our shit's so bad, why's your sister tryna fuck us?
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Saying, "Look at these bad ass stupid motherfuckers"
