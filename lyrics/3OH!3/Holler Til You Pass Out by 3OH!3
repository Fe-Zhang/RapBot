[Intro: Nathaniel Motte]
I’ma hit you from the back, I-I’ma hit you from the
I’ma hit you from the back, I-I’ma hit you from the
I’ma hit you from the back, I-I’ma hit you from the
I’ma hit you from the back and make you holler ‘til you pass out

[Refrain: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Holler back, holler back
Holler back, holler back
Holler back, holler back
Holler back, holler back

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte & Both]
If you gots a neat stash (Give me half, give me half)
And if you roll up on some cash (Give me half, give me half)
And if your momma’s in the back (Give me half, give me half)
And you know I got that base bat, base bat, base bat
Bitches on the dick, give ‘em 3OH!3
Poppin’ motherfuckers like "you know me"
Shinin' in the club with the goatee
Rollin’ on the dubs like a OG
Get them hands crackin’ in the 3OH!3
Get them hands crackin’ in the 3OH!3

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I’ma hit you from the back and make you holler ‘til you pass out
Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I’ma hit you from the back and make you holler ‘til you pass out

[Post-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Oh, bang bang, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Oh, bang bang, oh, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Oh, bang bang, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Oh, bang bang, oh, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it just me?
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it just me?
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it just me?
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it 3OH!3?

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
You’s a punkbitch if you don’t know ‘bout Boulder
Your girl’s a freak ‘cause that’s what I told her
You think you’re tight, but my ice gets colder
In Baller-ado, fighting with my soldiers
You know we clean, never smokin’ that doja
The gang sign, 'cause that’s what we hold up

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I’ma hit you from the back and make you holler ‘til you pass out
Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I said, "Hey yeah, shake-shake your ass now"
I’ma hit you from the back and make you holler ‘til you pass out

[Post-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Oh, bang bang, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Oh, bang bang, oh, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Oh, bang bang, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Oh, bang bang, oh, bang bang, motherfuckin’ street slang
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it just me?
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it just me?
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it just me?
Is it gettin’ hot in here or is it 3OH!3?
