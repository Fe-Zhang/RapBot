[Verse 1]
I got a date in San Jos√©
I got a flight that I gotta take tonight
'Cause I got plans in Tokyo, Japan
I got a cabin in Switzerland
I got a dinner in Rio de Janeiro
Wake up next to pharaohs hungover in Cairo
Sleeping in, it's the weekend, New Zealand
And then it's back to CO to rock the show

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I have to go
There's so many ladies that I know
You could try to get me here to stay
But you know that I'll be leaving here today

[Chorus]
(Ohh...) I gotta go now
(Ohh...) I really wanna stay
(Ohh...) 'Cause I know how to say... (say... say...)
I'm always in a different time zone
My home's where I roam
I'm never gonna stop, I'm a rolling stone
(Ohh...) 'Cause I know how to say... (say...)
Love a million different ways (Ohh...)

[Verse 2]
Stumblin' on the streets of Berlin
We can french kiss through the border fences
There's underwear on the mic stand in Iceland
Then, it's back to N.Y.C. on the M-I-C
I've got a party in Saudi Arabia
Drunk in a building, so high in Dubai
I wanna touch her in a parka in Russia
It was nice to see ya, but this is goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I have to go
There's so many ladies that I know
You could try to get me here to stay
But you know that I'll be leaving here today

[Chorus]
(Ohh...) I gotta go now
(Ohh...) I really wanna stay
(Ohh...) 'Cause I know how to say... (say... say...)
I'm always in a different time zone
My home's where I roam
I'm never gonna stop, I'm a rolling stone
(Ohh...) 'Cause I know how to say... (say...)
Love a million different ways (Ohh...)

[Bridge]
Ai shi teru, te amo, I love you, je t'aime
Everywhere I go, I always say the same thing
In Russia, Japan, Brazil, Spain
Everywhere I go, they seem to scream the same name
Ai shi teru, te amo, I love you, je t'aime
Everywhere I go, I always say the same thing
In Russia, Japan, Brazil, Spain
Everywhere I go, they seem to scream the same name

[Chorus]
(Ohh...) I gotta go now
(Ohh...) I really wanna stay
(Ohh...) 'Cause I know how to say... (say... say...)
I'm always in a different time zone
My home's where I roam
I'm never gonna stop, I'm a rolling stone
(Ohh...) 'Cause I know how to say... (say...)
Love a million different ways (Ohh...)
