[Intro]
Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind
Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind

[Verse 1]
I tried to leave the house but she won't let me out
Deadbolts lock got me strapped to the couch
She's got a dirtier mind than my mouth
I hate to say the more you fuck the better for your health

[Refrain]
She wants me at the party, she wants me at the mall
She wants me in the bathroom stall
She wants me at the party, she wants me at the mall
She wants me in the bathroom stall

[Chorus]
Hey you, I know what you gonna do
I wanna be the person that you do it to
Hey you, I wanna be the person you do, you do, you do, you do
Hey you, I know what you gonna do
I wanna be the person that you do it to
Hey you, I wanna be the person you do, you do, you do, you do

[Post-Chorus]
Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind
Dirty mind, dirty mind
She just wants to fuck me all the time
Time, time, all the time
Time, time, all the time
Time, time, all the time
She just wants to fuck me all the time

[Verse 2]
Of course I'm not mad about too much sex
I'm mad because I gotta be at home by six
Just because you learned a new posi-tion
Fuck it, let's do it in the kitchen

[Refrain]
She wants me at the party, she wants me at the mall
She wants me in the bathroom stall
She wants me at the party, she wants me at the mall
She wants me in the bathroom stall

[Chorus]
Hey you, I know what you gonna do
I wanna be the person that you do it to
Hey you, I wanna be the person you do, you do, you do, you do
Hey you, I know what you gonna do
I wanna be the person that you do it to
Hey you, I wanna be the person you do, you do, you do, you do

[Post-Chorus]
Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind
Dirty mind, dirty mind
She just wants to fuck me all the time, shes got a
Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind
Dirty mind, dirty mind
She just wants to fuck me all the time
Time, time, all the time
Time, time, all the time
Time, time, all the time
She just wants to fuck me all the time

[Bridge]
D-d-dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty, dirty mind

Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind
Dirty mind, dirty mind

Dirty mind, dirty mind, d-d-d-d-dirty mind
Dirty mind, dirty mind
She just wants to fuck me all the time time time
