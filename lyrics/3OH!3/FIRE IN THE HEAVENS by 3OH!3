[Intro]
Three (three, three, three)
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Three (three, three, three)
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Three (three, three, three)
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Three (three, three, three)
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Three (three, three, three)
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Three (three, three, three)

[Verse 1: Nathaniel Motte]
We're howling at the painted skies
Oh (oh, oh, oh)
Shooting down your favorite satellite
Cause every time we're feeling like we're falling
Been trading places with the blinded star

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
Do I need to say it?
Spray you with a can of paint just to see it?
Across a freight train
I don't fight, I'm undefeated
And that's my life game
3OH!3, you best repeat it
I'm teething, ripping the pieces
Your student thesis of all of the reasons that I've been squeezing
Sitting here breathing
Summon the beast and 666
Then minus the threes and that'd be the region where we be freezing
But we're releasing all of the demons
When I'm inspired, I spit fire up higher like it's open season

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
(Do I need to say it?)
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
Baby there's a fire in the heavens
