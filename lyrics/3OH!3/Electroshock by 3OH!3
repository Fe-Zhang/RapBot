[Verse 1]
Sweat, sweat, ‘cause I’m a poisonous pill
Pop me in your mouth, baby, sit and be still
Uh, not yet, I ain’t through with you girl
Put me in your glass, baby, give me a swirl
I said, sweat, sweat, ‘cause I’m a poisonous pill
Pop me in your mouth, baby, sit and be still
Not yet, I ain’t through with you girl
Put me in your glass, baby, give me a swirl
Don’t stop, don’t let it (oh!)
Freeze up your trembling limbs
Don’t you regret it
‘Cause you can bet that this won’t even ever happen again

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold me close tiny dancer
The only thing I gots is electrorock cancer
I saw a picture on the canvas
Baby’s got a ciggy in her lips and knows she’s cancerous

[Chorus]
Yes, yes, in your tight white dress
You’re all alone and I’m about to microphone check
Oh yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electrorock and steady now (clear!)
Yes, yes, in my tight white vest
You’re all alone and I’m about to microphone check
Oh yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electrorock and steady now (clear!)

[Verse 2]
Well I said, sweat, sweat, ‘cause I’m a poisonous pill
Pop me in your mouth, baby, sit and be still
Uh, not yet, I ain’t through with you girl
Put me in your glass, baby, give me a swirl
I am a static hat full of magic tricks
You are kinetic, slow down baby
You’re leavin’ so quick

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold me close tiny dancer
The only thing I gots is electrorock cancer
I saw a picture on the canvas
Baby’s got a ciggy in her lips and knows she’s cancerous

[Chorus]
Yes, yes, in your tight white dress
You’re all alone and I’m about to microphone check
Oh yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electrorock and steady now (clear!)
Yes, yes, in my tight white vest
You’re all alone and I’m about to microphone check
Oh yeah, prep the area here
Shock, shock, electrorock and steady now (clear!)

[Outro]
Steady now, steady, steady now
(I am a static)
Steady now, steady, steady now
(Hat full of magic tricks)
Steady now, steady, steady now
(You are kinetic)
Steady now, steady, steady now, clear!
(Slow down baby, you're leavin’ so quick)
