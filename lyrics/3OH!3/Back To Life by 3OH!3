[Verse 1]
There's a drum line in my heartbeat
I know exactly what it's from
They're turning off the street lamps
They say the day is almost done
There's a ringing in my ears now
I remember how it was
The feeling we had last night
And it won't stop now because

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Everybody says, "Hey, no!
We don't wanna see this day go
If I ever had my say, so
We can make this go all night, night, night"

[Chorus]
'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way

[Verse 2]
I got a song stuck in my head
I know exactly why it's there
There's a noise outside my bedroom
And I don't even care

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I ever said, "Go home"
Everybody here would say, "Hell no!"
All we gotta do is just let go
We can make it through the night

[Chorus]
'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Yeah, we can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm never gonna get these drums out of my head
And I'm never gonna get some sleep inside of my bed
And I'm sorry if "goodnight" is something I never said, said, said

[Chorus]
'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Yeah, we can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
