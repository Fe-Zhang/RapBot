[Intro: Sean Foreman]
One! Two! Three!

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
And if I had something to say to you, I’d whisper it softly
Ki-kiss you on your rosy lips and never let you off me
Sh-shiver on our roof and see your face lit by starlight
Hold you through the night and watch that Colorado sunrise

[Bridge: Sean Foreman]
I’ve got five fingers on each hand for every mistake that I’ve made
‘Cause my tongue is tied to tonsils and I need to shit and shave
I’m a shade too pale for handsome and have habits I can’t shake
But if you try to take that from me, well, I’ll never be the same

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
And as long as it’s okay with you, I think I’ll stay right here
I think I’ve got nowhere to go ‘cause where to go is up to you, dear
You’re happy as a clam, I see the glimmer in your eyes
Hold you through the night and watch that Colorado sunrise
I got no car and never cared because I got no place to go live in
A room, a single wall, I couldn’t pay a plant to grow
You can try to make this pretty, pick up all my dirty clothes
And if you never really get me then I guess you’ll never know the

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
A train wreck

[Bridge: Sean Foreman]
I’ve got five fingers on each hand for every mistake that I’ve made
Plus, my tongue is tied to tonsils and I need to shit and shave
I’m a shade too pale for handsome and have habits I can’t shake
But if you try to take that from me, well I wouldn’t be the same

[Outro: Sean Foreman]
Train wreck that I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
(And watch that Colorado sunrise)
A train wreck
That I am
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
(And watch that Colorado sunrise)
Train wreck that I am
(If I had something to say to you I’d whisper it softly)
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
(Kiss you on your rosy lips and never let you off me)
A train wreck that I am
(Shiver on our roof and see your face lit by the starlight)
And I am what I am, what I am, what I am
(Hold you through the night and watch that Colorado sunrise)
A train wreck
