[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
I am the sweat that glows under the moonlight
You are the heat that hovers on a June night
If only I could stay awake
I'd watch you drive away for good
You don't know the words to say, to say

[Chorus 1: Sean Foreman]
We burn quick on the edge of a match
We live fast cause there's nothing that's forever
So drive off and don't ever look back
But give me something, something to remember

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
We are the smoke stacks reaching for the sky
Yeah yeah, we light a cigarette and watch the stars die
If only I could stay awake
I'd watch you drive away for good
You don't know the words to say, to say

[Chorus 2: Sean Foreman]
We burn quick on the edge of a match
We live fast cause there's nothing that's forever
So drive off and don't ever look back
But give me something, something to remember
We kill the night like a firework sky
We go hard cause we know it's now or never
So break free and go chasing that high
But give me something, something to remember

[Bridge: Nathaniel Motte]
So we drive up the mountain that they call Flagstaff
You and I, we say goodbye where the power lines crash

[Chorus 2: Sean Foreman]
We burn quick on the edge of a match
We live fast cause there's nothing that's forever
So drive off and don't ever look back
But give me something, something to remember
We kill the night like a firework sky
We go hard cause we know it's now or never
So break free and go chasing that high
But give me something, something to remember
