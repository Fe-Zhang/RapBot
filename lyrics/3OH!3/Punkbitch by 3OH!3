[Verse 1]
When I come up in the club
I’m talkin’ mad shit
Come up in the club
I’m ‘bout to get my ass kicked
‘Cause I’m sippin’ on some Gin
Sip-sippin’ on some Jack
Slip 60 in her panties with my number on the back

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause the proof is in the Kodak
The throw-backs in a dark and vacant corner
You were freezing, I was warmer
And the roof is blown, you know that
And baby chases like she don’t know what she’s seeing
I was steady, you were fleeting

[Chorus]
Punkbitch (‘Cause I’ve seen it before)
Punkbitch (And I don’t care anymore)
Punkbitch (And I just want you to know)
Punkbitch
Punkbitch (‘Cause I’ve seen it before)
Punkbitch (And I don’t care anymore)
Punkbitch (And I just want you to know)
That we datin’ mad models
And poppin’ mad bottles tonight
Punkbitch (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
Punkbitch (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
Punkbitch (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
We datin’ mad models
And poppin’ mad bottles tonight

[Interlude]
Uh, yeah, sounds good
Throw me up in the headphones, sounds good

[Verse 2]
When I come up in the club
I’m actin’ mad dumb
Ladies lookin’ at me
Tell ‘em, “come and get some”
‘Cause I’m sippin’ on some Jack
Sip-sippin’ on some Gin
Tip-tippin’ all these strippers like I know them as my friends

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause the proof is in the Kodak
The throw-backs in a dark and vacant corner
You were freezing, I was warmer
And the roof is blown, you know that
And baby chases like she don’t know what she’s seeing
I was steady, you were fleeting

[Chorus]
Punkbitch (‘Cause I’ve seen it before)
Punkbitch (And I don’t care anymore)
Punkbitch (And I just want you to know)
Punkbitch
Punkbitch (‘Cause I’ve seen it before)
Punkbitch (And I don’t care anymore)
Punkbitch (And I just want you to know)
That we datin’ mad models
And poppin’ mad bottles tonight
Punkbitch (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
Punkbitch (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
Punkbitch (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
We datin’ mad models
And poppin’ mad bottles tonight

[Bridge]
Write it down
Scratch the nice
‘Cause I just can’t keep coming back
Punkbitch
Punkbitch
Punkbitch
Punkbitch

[Outro]
You put my picture in a box
It was the one inside your locket
What happened to the keys
That used to jingle in your pocket?
Your fingers say to come
But your eyes say I should stop it
If I regret all I’ve done
I would be trapped inside that locket
You put my picture in a box
It was the one inside your locket (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
What happened to the keys
That used to jingle in your pocket (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
Your fingers say to come
But your eyes say I should stop it (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
If I regret all I’ve done
I would be trapped inside that locket (Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh)
You put my picture in a box (‘Cause I’ve seen it before)
It was the one inside your locket
What happened to the keys (And I don’t care anymore)
That used to jingle in your pocket
Your fingers say to come (And I just want you to know)
But your eyes say I should stop it
If I regret all I’ve done
I would be trapped inside that locket
(That we datin’ mad models and poppin’ mad bottles tonight)
