[Chorus]
I used to have two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about one
Two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about

[Verse 1]
(Hit 'em!) Yeah, yeah, I'm back again
Throw a hashtag in front of that trend
Huffing and puffing, so let me in
I just need a little bit of medicine
Oh no, strap on my sneakers
You don't need to play, watch from the bleachers
Ice so shiny that it gives you seizures
Clutch that ball, but I will beat cha'
And I'm sorry, I gotta do this here
But you hang with dicks like a pubic hair
With an icy stare, got it worse than Medusa
Got me rock hard, shootin' off 'zooka
Yeah, yeah, I said it too
This is like no edit, undo
What the fuck did I get myself into? (Wish I knew)

[Chorus]
I used to have two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about one
Two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about

[Verse 2]
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
And Adele ain't on this track
Did I say that? Oh yeah, I must've
Black and Yellow, Burger Mustard
Not even just a little bit flustered
Write it all down while I'm waitin' at the bus stop
Looking at a girl with a Skrillex haircut
Thinking to myself "Oh my god, this is America!"
Haha, this is blasphemy
Get away with it like Casey Anthony
Mixed in chemicals, this is alchemy
Drunk as fuck, hold a kid off the balcony
Zombie Killer
Manilla envelope being cracked in the middle
Girlfriend sitter, I'm a high space shitter
What?

[Chorus]
I used to have two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about one
Two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about

[Verse 3]
I said I'm back, Lindsay Lohan
Watch me ride this track, no hands
'Cause I've been on the bike
Been around the block like every other night
Yeah, 'til the sun burns out
Zombie style, words out our mouth
Dead and I'll leave em' squirming
No protection, Rick Santorum
Haha, damn near wrecked 'em
Every time that I rhyme on the kick drum
You'll be bleeding out your eardrum
Like "Goddamn, I couldn't even hear them coming"
Yeah, we hit the ground running
Goddamn now, ain't that something?
I used to have two girls, now I got nothing

[Chorus]
I used to have two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about one
Two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about
I used to have two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about one
Two girlfriends
Now, I got none
'Cause my number two girl found out about (one!)
