[Refrain: Nathaniel Motte]
Who’s signin’ records with the quickness?
Who finish reppin’ with the sickness?
Who’s signin’ records with the quickness?
Who finish reppin’ with the sickness?

[Bridge: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
I see the glimmer in that di-a-mond
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
Gettin’ women like we hire ‘em
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
I see the glimmer in that di-a-mond
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
Gettin’ women like we hire ‘em

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
Yep, yeah, Photo Finish
You know we always finish first place
That’s why we’re rappin’ in the first place
First page
And we at the finish line
Yep, yeah, Photo Finish
Signin’ on the dotted line (c’mon)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Motherfuckers fuckin’ like they know me
(3OH!3, Photo Finish, 2008)

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
You always hedgin’ on a safe bet
Walkin’ a tight rope with a safety net
Face it, it doesn’t mean shit unless you take a risk
Shush baby, shut your mouth
‘Cause you’re not part of this, this time
You always hedgin’ on a safe bet
Walkin’ a tight rope with a safety net
Face it, it doesn’t mean shit unless you take a risk
Shush baby, shut your mouth
‘Cause you’re not part of this, this time

[Refrain: Nathaniel Motte]
Who’s signin’ records with the quickness?
Who finish reppin’ with the sickness?
Who’s signin’ records with the quickness?
Who finish reppin’ with the sickness?

[Bridge: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
I see the glimmer in that di-a-mond
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
Gettin’ women like we hire ‘em
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
I see the glimmer in that di-a-mond
Oh, I say, "Yep, yep, Photo Finish"
Gettin’ women like we hire ‘em

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
Yep, yeah, Photo Finish
Uh-oh, no, he didn’t say that
I’ma wait ‘til I get paid back
Play it back
Like he did it first take
Yeah, Photo Finish
Runnin’ through the red tape (c’mon)

[Pre-Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
Motherfuckers fuckin’ like they know me

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
You always hedgin’ on a safe bet
Walkin’ a tight rope with a safety net
Face it, it doesn’t mean shit unless you take a risk
Shush baby, shut your mouth
‘Cause you’re not part of this, this time
You always hedgin’ on a safe bet
Walkin’ a tight rope with a safety net
Face it, it doesn’t mean shit unless you take a risk
Shush baby, shut your mouth
‘Cause you’re not part of this, this time

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
You always hedgin’ on a safe bet
Walkin’ a tight rope with a safety net
Face it, it doesn’t mean shit unless you take a risk
Shush baby, shut your mouth
‘Cause you’re not part of this, this time
You always hedgin’ on a safe bet
Walkin’ a tight rope with a safety net
Face it, it doesn’t mean shit unless you take a risk
Shush baby, shut your mouth
‘Cause you’re not part of this, this time
