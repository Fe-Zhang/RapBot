[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
Underneath the cold moon
In the parking lot I told you
Didn't even know you'd take back the hours we wasted
We're frozen in the headlights
We're slipping on the black ice
Shouldn't have to act nice
Blood in the air, I could taste it

[Verse 2: Nathaniel Motte]
I found out you were mutual the night you said that you went home
You played me like a musical
Said ignorance is beautiful
I found out you were mutual the night you said that you went home
You tricked me with the dude I know the wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
You said you wouldn't
But you did it
Why you lying?
I ain't kidding
Hands numb, can't feel
This love's not real
Now I'm finding
Your handwriting
'Cross the ceiling
Close my eyes and say, "How'd I get here?"
This love's not real

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
I lost touch with who I am
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram
This castle is made of sand
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram

[Verse 3: Sean Foreman]
Double yellow lines like
Slipping in the back night
I'm losing all my lifelines
Never thought you could erase them

[Verse 4: Nathaniel Motte]
This world is full of hypocrites and bitches claiming innocence
Yeah I just came to witness it
And leave here with no fingerprints
This world is full of hypocrites and bitches claiming innocence
We wanted you to be the prince, but itâ€™s incestuous

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
You said you wouldn't
But you did it
Why you lying?
I ain't kidding
Hands numb, can't feel
This love's not real
Now I'm finding
Your handwriting
'Cross the ceiling
Close my eyes and say, "How'd I get here?"
This love's not real

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
I lost touch with who I am
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram
This castle is made of sand
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram

[Bridge: Nathaniel Motte]
Cold sweat, shaking with the fever dream
Go back to the same crime scene
Now my ears baby won't stop ringing
My ears, yeah, they won't stop ringing
Cold sweat, shaking with the fever dream
Go back to the same crime scene
Now my ears, yeah, they won't stop ringing

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
I lost touch with who I am
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram
This castle is made of sand
I am just a hollow man
In love with a hologram

[Outro: Nathaniel Motte]
Clean me in your river
You can wash me with your water
Purify me till I shiver
Cause I've been seeing ghosts
Is this me finally losing it?
Or an optical illusion?
Every beat I make is unfinished
And every song I write is ill conceived
When all the cities fade and we diminish
Will anyone remember you and me?
