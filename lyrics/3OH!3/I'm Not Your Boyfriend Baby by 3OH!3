[Refrain]
I’m not your boyfriend, baby
I ain’t your cute little sex toy
I’m not your lion or your tiger
Won’t be your nasty little boy
I’m not your boyfriend, baby
I can’t grant your every wish
I’m not your knight in shining armor
So I just leave you with this kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
You can catch me on the speed train
Beeper in a three-way
Shinin’ with the gleam chain
And your honey givin’ me brain
You can catch me watchin’ A.I
Man, now it’s game time
Pinkie with the same shine
Pitbull and a canine

[Chorus]
You know I rep this shit
I gots it tatted on my skin
If you fuckin’ with my city
Then you fuckin’ with my kin
You know I rep this shit
I got my hands up on your chest
Motherfuckers best believe it
That you’re fuckin’ with the best

[Refrain]
I’m not your boyfriend, baby
I ain’t your cute little sex toy
I’m not your lion or your tiger
Nah, nah, won’t be your nasty little boy (Woo!)
I’m not your boyfriend, baby
Yeah, I can’t grant your every wish
I’m not your knight in shining armor, oh!
So I just leave you with this kiss

[Verse]
Kill the lights
These children learn from cigarette burns
Fast cars, fast women and cheap drinks
It feels right
All these asphyxiated, self-medicated
Take the white pill, you’ll feel alright
Kill the lights
These children learn from cigarette burns
Fast cars, fast women and cheap drinks
It feels right
All these asphyxiated, self-medicated

[Pre-Chorus]
You can catch me on the speed train
Beeper in a three-way
Shinin’ with the gleam chain
And your honey givin’ me brain
You can catch me watchin’ A.I
Man, now it’s game time
Pinkie with the same shine
Pitbull and a canine

[Chorus]
You know I rep this shit
I gots it tatted on my skin
If you fuckin’ with my city
Then you fuckin’ with my kin
You know I rep this shit
I got my hands up on your chest
Motherfuckers best believe it
That you’re fuckin’ with the best

[Outro]
Kill the lights
These children learn from cigarette burns
Fast cars, fast women and cheap drinks
It feels right
All these asphyxiated, self-medicated
Take the white...
Kill the lights
These children learn from cigarette burns
Fast cars, fast women and cheap drinks
It feels right
All these asphyxiated, self-medicated
Take the white pill, you’ll feel alright
Kill the lights
These children learn from cigarette burns
Fast cars, fast women and cheap drinks
It feels right
All these asphyxiated, self-medicated
Take the white pill, you’ll feel alright
Kill the lights
These children learn from cigarette burns
Fast cars, fast women and cheap drinks
It feels right
All these asphyxiated, self-medicated
Take the white pill, you’ll feel alright
