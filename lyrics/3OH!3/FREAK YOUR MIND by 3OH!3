[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
Heartless vagabond
Fresh from out of town
I, I'm looking for a new high
Someone to help me get by
Barstool veteran
Liquid medicine
You, you found me at a good time
Tonight you can be all mine
(You can be all mine)

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Don't gotta be no centerfold
For me to want to take you home
If your heart is beating
Let me freak your body baby
Don't have to be the perfect ten
For us to be more than friends
If your heart is beating
Let me freak your body baby
But first, imma freak your mind

[Verse 2: Nathaniel Motte]
Cold kiss, deviant
Dark room telling no lies
We're sweating in the blacklight
Painting on you with a flashlight

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
I don't care what you want from life
Only care what you are tonight
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Don't gotta be no centerfold
For me to want to take you home
If your heart is beating
Let me freak your body baby
Don't have to be the perfect ten
For us to be more than friends
If your heart is beating
Let me freak your body baby
But first, imma freak your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
I don't care what you want from life
Only care what you are tonight
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
I don't care what you want from life
Only care what you are tonight
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Don't gotta be no centerfold
For me to want to take you home
If your heart is beating
Don't have to be the perfect ten
For us to be more than friends
If your heart is beating, beating, beating, beating
Let me freak your body baby
Let me freak your...
Let me freak your body baby
Let me freak your body baby
But first, imma freak your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
I don't care what you want from life
Only care what you are tonight
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
I don't care what you want from life
Only care what you are tonight
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
You are beauti-beauti-beautiful
