[Bridge]
Faster than a bullet train
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang
Faster than a bullet train
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang

[Verse 1]
You've read that I was bad news
Before you even met me
You know the dudes I hang with
They ain't exactly friendly
99 bottles on the wall until they empty
You were such a plain jane
Now you go bang bang

[Pre-Chorus]
It was only one kiss, one night
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right

[Chorus]
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot

[Post-Chorus]
She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot

[Verse 2]
I had 30 missed calls and dirty mix drinks
When you found me getting in flirting with the girl on the sink
Call me David Copperfield
Poof, gone before you blink
And you complain the blame game
I think it goes bang bang

[Pre-Chorus]
It was only one kiss, one night
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right

[Chorus]
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot

[Post-Chorus]
She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot

[Bridge]
Faster than a bullet train
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang

[Post-Chorus]
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoota
