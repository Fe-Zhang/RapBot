[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Verse 1]
There's a place in my head
That repeats what you said
That repeats what you said that day
You're afraid the mistakes that you made
Dug your grave but
Baby that's the price you pay

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't shut down
This town, ain't big enough for both of us, whoa
And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me
So, baby, I'm a set you free
Yeah I'm a set you free

[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me
But I don't live in there no more (No more)
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Verse 2]
I been trying to relate to
All the things that make you
Act the crazy ways you do (You do)
But that will take patience and headaches
To make sense
Some the things you put me through

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't shut down
This town, ain't big enough for both of us, whoa
And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me
So, baby, I'm a set you free
Yeah, I'm a set you free

[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me
But I don't live in there no more (No more)
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Bridge]
All the pictures and the windows on the wall
Are closing in on me
I thought that you're suppose to learn from
What went wrong in history
So you keep doing everything you can
And never will get to me
I bet you remember the day you were better
As soon as we severed
And you were free
All the pictures and the windows on the wall
Are closing in on me
I thought that you're suppose to learn from
What went wrong in history
So you keep doing everything you can
And never will get to me
I bet you remember the day you were better
As soon as we severed
And you were free

[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
