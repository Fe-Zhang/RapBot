[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
Cold coffee, drive slow
Watch the houses disappear, row by row
Head hurts, sweatshirts
Eyes to the ground; a town of introverts
Cold sweat gets old
Want the serotonin to come home
Wake up, no luck
Telling time by lines of beer in my cup

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Take away all my fun
You know you can tie a noose around my tongue
The man at the wheel driving my mind is drunk
The focus is gone

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in
This town has a hold of us
The claws are tearing at my skin
Now my conscience is leaving
The words are for speaking
There's no one to speak them to
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
Matchbox, padlocks
In the shopping bag 'cross the parking lot
Small clouds, leave mouth
See the shadow stretching 'til the light runs out

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Take away all my fun
You know you can tie a noose around my tongue
The man at the wheel driving my mind is drunk
The focus is gone (The focus is gone)

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in
This town has a hold of us
The claws are tearing at my skin
Now my conscious is leaving
The words are for speaking
There's no one to speak them to
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in

[Bridge: Nathaniel Motte]
I always hoped that you could just stay dead
Radioactive in your crown of lead
Deep underneath the pillars of this bed
Yeah, I always hoped that you would just stay dead

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in
This town has a hold of us
The claws are tearing at my skin
Now my conscious is leaving
The words are for speaking
There's no one to speak them to
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in
