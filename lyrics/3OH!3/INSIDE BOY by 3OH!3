[Intro: Sean Foreman]
Inside boy, yeah
Inside boy, yeah

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
She gets me woozy
Chasing for that coochie
Give her the Hitchcock when we're making a home movie
Yeah, she my cutie
Can put the blow in Hootie
This shit is Disney
I'm the beast and she's the booty
Met her when she was a freshman
My friends were like, "you hitting?"
I was like, "yes man."
But it was more than that
Had me poppin' off the top, I lose my starter cap
Blood was rushing down, and I don't mean a heart attack
I mean all of that
Reading Braille off her garter strap
Oh I got it bad
I can draw her body with a pen and pad
She got me thrusting like a rocket off of Cape Canav
And there ain't nothing wrong with that

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
That's that new new rich, Huey, Dewey, and Louie
Like a ru-rude bitch
Steal that shit out your Gucci
I'm do, do this
Poppin' off like an Uzi
And hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy
(Okay)
Till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)
Till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)
Till we get woozy
(Woo)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
Coming off as kind of weirdo
She said that she liked my beard though
Imma get her to speak in binary
By the end of the night
Barring a fight or a possible blackout
We could sneak out at the back door
And kiss like Spiderman pulling his mask down
Am I speaking too fast now?
I see you poking that ass out
Fold 'em or hold 'em
Fuck it, I should just go and cash out
But I got no doubt, no Stefani that you want me
Gonna hold it out, till you blow like kamikaze

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Foreman]
Inside boy, yeah
I'll settle for
Inside boy, yeah
You don't know me

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
That's that new new rich, Huey, Dewey, and Louie
Like a ru-rude bitch
Steal that shit out your Gucci
I'm do, do this
Poppin' off like an Uzi
And hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy
(Okay)
Till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)
Till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)
Till we get woozy
(Woo)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy

[Bridge: Sean Foreman]
Inside boy, use my inside voice
Here to make some noise
Pissing on your boyfriend's Rolls Royce
Like I had a choice
Making sacrificial offerings to annoy the demon that's been bursting from my dreams like every night
Like give me something to believe in
Or I'm fuckin' leavin'
I've been drinking on the weekend
Diving in the pool and waking in the deep end
Raging while you're sleeping
Call me Scottie Pippen, cause I've been steady pimping ever since I started breathing

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
That's that new new rich, Huey, Dewey, and Louie
Like a ru-rude bitch
Steal that shit out your Gucci
I'm do, do this
Poppin' off like an Uzi
And hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy
(Okay)
Till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)
Till we get woozy
(Inside boy, yeah)
Till we get woozy
(Woo)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it till we get woozy
