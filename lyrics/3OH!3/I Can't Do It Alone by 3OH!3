[Verse 1]
Oh God, oh God, she’s really done it now
Coked up, her body’s all spun around
Oh yeah, yeah, she’s really done it
And seein’ her just isn’t something I can stomach

[Pre-Chorus]
Back it up, back it up
If you talkin’ shit to me
Smack it up, smack it up
If you act a bitch to me
Stack it up, stack it up
If you fuckin’ rich as me
My daddy owns a dealership
The rest is fuckin’ history

[Chorus]
This ain’t a love song (oh, no)
This ain’t a broken heart homie singin’ only ‘cause he’s lonely
This ain’t a love song (oh, no, no, no)
This ain’t a whiskey-drowned ballad
There ain’t nothing here that’s valid
So tell me baby, pretty baby, that this house is not a graveyard
Tell me how to stay strong and carry you home
Over corpses of her long-lost fathers and her unborn daughters
‘Cause Goddammit, I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone
No, I can’t do it alone

[Verse 2]
Oh no, no, I’m not impressed with you
Pink drinks that seem to get the best of you
Rock late and sleep until the sun sets
I’d talk but you took the tongue I talk with

[Pre-Chorus]
Back it up, back it up
If you talkin’ shit to me
Smack it up, smack it up
If you act a bitch to me
Stack it up, stack it up
If you fuckin’ rich as me
My daddy owns a dealership
The rest is fuckin’ history

[Chorus]
This ain’t a love song (oh, no)
This ain’t a broken heart homie singin’ only ‘cause he’s lonely
This ain’t a love song (oh, no, no, no)
This ain’t a whiskey-drowned ballad
There ain’t nothing here that’s valid
So tell me baby, pretty baby, that this house is not a graveyard
Tell me how to stay strong and carry you home
Over corpses of her long-lost fathers and her unborn daughters
‘Cause Goddammit, I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone
I can’t do it alone
No, I can’t do it alone

[Bridge]
I can call you out and complain the rain is worse
But it’s that much better if I did it all in person
And I can curse you out and complain the rain is worse
But it’s that much better if I did it all in person

[Chorus]
So tell me baby, pretty baby, that this house is not a graveyard
Tell me how to stay strong and carry you home
Over corpses of her long-lost fathers and her unborn daughters
‘Cause Goddammit, I can’t do it alone
So tell me baby, pretty baby, that this house is not a graveyard
Tell me how to stay strong and carry you home
Over corpses of her long-lost fathers and her unborn daughters
‘Cause Goddammit, I can’t do it alone
