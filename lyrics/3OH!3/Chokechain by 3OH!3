[Refrain]
I got this shit on lock
I got this shit on lock
Holler, holler at me if you on my block
I got this shit on lock
I got this shit on lock
Holler, holler at me if you on my block

[Verse 1]
I got your dogs on a collar, baller
So how you like that?
Chokechain for their necks and I don’t think they bite back
“Woof, woof” how they howl
Get some chow, they ‘bout to growl
Little dogs will kill you dude, as soon as you let ‘em out
Pure bread (Pure bread)
Got ‘em with the nice coat
Your head (Your head)
When I stick ‘em at the right throat
Big teeth (Big teeth)
Shock collars on their necks
You fuck with 3OH!3 and motherfuckers know they next

[Pre-Chorus]
Now getcha drum on (C’mon and getcha drum on)
Getcha, getcha drum on (C’mon and getcha drum on)

[Chorus]
I got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rottweiler
Got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rottweiler
Got a chokechain (Ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (Sh-sh-shock collar)
I got a choke chain (Ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (Sh-sh-shock collar)

[Verse 2]
I got my wolf on my white Tee, he won’t bite me
Fuckin’ with me, and you’ll get bitten most likely
Howlin’ at the moon, growlin’ at the lightning
Uh, this thing I spit is mad frightening
We got the drum hits, tell your kid to get a bit of etiquette
Before he splits his seed to try to spit a little bit of rhetoric
You gotta sa-say, g-g-go put it away
Yeah, we be runnin’ the game, yeah, it’s all one in the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Now getcha drum on (C’mon and getcha drum on)
Getcha, getcha drum on (C’mon and getcha drum on)

[Refrain]
I got this shit on lock
I got this shit on lock
Holler, holler at me if you on my block
I got this shit on lock
I got this shit on lock
Holler, holler at me if you on my block

[Chorus]
I got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rottweiler
Got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rottweiler
Got a chokechain (Ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (Sh-sh-shock collar)
I got a choke chain (Ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (Sh-sh-shock collar)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rottweiler
Got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rottweiler
Chokechain (Ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (Sh-sh-shock collar)
I got a choke chain (Ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (Sh-sh-shock collar)
