[Verse 1]
We on three nights and no sleep
Roll with those who know me
We chillin’ up so high
Yeah, you can find us in the nose bleeds
Fresh kicks and yes seats
A diamond on both feet
We living like we don’t care what tomorrow's gonna be
Everybody in this place is either blind or gonna see
That everything I need is right in front of me

[Chorus]
So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down you’d better pick a side
’Cause baby, it's do or die
Baby, it's do or die
So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down...
Baby, it's do or die!

[Verse 2]
It seems like four nights, still awake
Shake so bad I need to take
One shot for my lady and twenty for those that got away
Don’t feel bad, I’m okay
Watch me Transform, Michael Bay
Standing on the table, shouting
"Warriors! Come out and Play!"

[Chorus]
So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down you’d better pick a side
’Cause baby, it's do or die
Baby, it's do or die
So throw your phone away and let the night decide
’Cause when the sun goes down...
Baby, it's do or die!

[Bridge]
I’m thinking that this beast is apart of me
’Cause I can’t seem to sleep for the death of me
So I throw away my phone and let the night decide
Then I can't ever settle down until the day I die
Oh no, we did it again
We stayed up all night, we ain’t sleepin' in
You don’t know where I have been
I got the devil hiding underneath my skin
Drink up, we need a medicine
If we wanna dive into the night, my friend
Everything comes to an end
So you know this time it's do or die again

[Outro]
Baby, it's do or die
