[Intro]
Gonna have a house party in my house

[Verse 1]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (party!)
Thursday, Friday, Saturday (party!)
Sunday, better find somebody else
So for one day, I don't have to clean up after myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody say fuck the clubs (fuck the clubs!)
Fuck the clubs (fuck the clubs!)
Say "Fuck the clubs" (fuck the clubs!)
I'm not going out
Everybody say fuck the clubs (fuck the clubs!)
Fuck the clubs (fuck the clubs!)
Fuck the clubs
I'll be getting love in my house

[Chorus]
I'm gonna have a house party in my house
I'm gonna pour booze down my mouth
I might stay up until the A.M
Yeah, I think tonight I'm just gonna stay in
I'm gonna have a house party in my house
I'm gonna pour booze down my mouth
I might stay up until the A.M
Yeah, I think tonight I'm just gonna stay in

[Verse 2]
8 o' clock, 10 o' clock, midnight (party!)
2 o' clock, 4 o' clock, 6 o' clock (party!)
7 A.M., better get the fuck out
'Cause there ain't no room to be crashing on my couch

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody say fuck the DJs (fuck the DJs!)
Fuck the DJs (fuck the DJs!)
Say "Fuck the DJs"
If they ain't playing my shit
Everybody say fuck the DJs (fuck the DJs!)
Fuck the DJs (fuck the DJs!)
Fuck the DJs
At my house, I'll be playing my shit

[Chorus]
I'm gonna have a house party in my house
I'm gonna pour booze down my mouth
I might stay up until the A.M
Yeah, I think tonight I'm just gonna stay in
I'm gonna have a house party in my house
I'm gonna pour booze down my mouth
I might stay up until the A.M
Yeah, I think tonight I'm just gonna stay in

[Bridge]
Fuck if I know if there's a better place to go
'Cause there ain't no party if it ain't my party
Fuck if I know if there's a better place to go
'Cause there ain't no party if it ain't my party

[Chorus]
I'm gonna have a house party in my house
I'm gonna pour booze down my mouth
I might stay up until the A.M
Yeah, I think tonight I'm just gonna stay in
I'm gonna have a house party in my house
I'm gonna pour booze down my mouth
I might stay up until the A.M
Yeah, I think tonight I'm just gonna stay in
