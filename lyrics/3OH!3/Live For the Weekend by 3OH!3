[Chorus]
Oh yeah, party in the city
Drinkin' if you're with me, then we'll be passed out on the floor
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made they made the weekend for
Oh no, take it to the basement
So many girls and you know I got patience for more
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made the weekend for

[Verse 1]
I ain't scared of death
The bitch is scared of me
Got her looking for me constantly like she got O.C.D
I'm laughing at these suckers
While they're clutching on their rosaries
I'm running laps around the world
And you watch from the nosebleeds
Oh gee whiz
Yeah, the 3OH!3 is here with something offensive to say to your kids
F-f-fuck your little chatroom of how we should live
And get out of your parents house and do your own shit

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was little kid
Dirt on my sneakers
Used to blow out all my parents new speakers
Never went to bed
Never took a nap
I still do that, I still do that

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, party in the city
Drinkin' if you're with me, then we'll be passed out on the floor
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made they made the weekend for
Oh no, take it to the basement
So many girls and you know I got patience for more
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made the weekend for

[Verse 2]
Rolling in the backseat
With a few athletes
Girls are looking fit
Got more curves than a track meet
And I'm Prefontaine
When I'm running that game
Cutting through the conversation like cocaine
Girl you understand a single thing that I'm saying
We could blow up real big, propane
I came, I saw, now I need to conquer
So let's kick it old school like notes on a locker

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was little kid
Dirt on my sneakers
Used to blow out all my parents new speakers
Never went to bed
Never took a nap
I still do that, I still do that

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, party in the city
Drinkin' if you're with me, then we'll be passed out on the floor
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made they made the weekend for
Oh no, take it to the basement
So many girls and you know I got patience for more
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made the weekend for

[Bridge]
Fuck your little chatroom!
F-f-fuck your little chatroom!
F-f-fuck your little chatroom!
F-f-fuck your little chatroom!

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, party in the city
Drinkin' if you're with me, then we'll be passed out on the floor
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made they made the weekend for
Oh no, take it to the basement
So many girls and you know I got patience for more
I know I'll be fine
That's what they made the weekend for
