[Verse 1]
Tongue in cheek ‘til a hole burns out her mouth
And fingers' crossed like the promise of Cub Scouts
And we know that the picture in her heart-shaped locket’s
Far from an inanimate object
She’s as dark as the blood pulsing under her skin
Still afraid of the boogey man under her bed
And we know that the ashes in the urn was a person
And we never should have burned him

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it like you ‘bouts to get paid
Ah, boom swaggaboom like you gots a peg leg (uh!)
Shake it, shake it like you ‘bouts to get paid
Ah, boom swaggaboom like you gots a peg leg

[Post-Chorus]
I’m game, you’re game, you’re the main attraction
And the way you fit your jeans, makes me ready for action
I’m game, you’re game, you’re the main attraction
And the way you fit your jeans, makes me ready for action
Break it down to a fraction
I’m doing decimal subtraction to find a reaction
Break it down to a fraction
I’m doing decimal subtraction to find a reaction

[Refrain]
This is for the CO, 3OH!3, my people
We got the music that you can’t stand still to
And even if you don’t dance (don’t dance)
I gotta get you out and take this chance
This is for the CO, 3OH!3, my people
We got the music that you can’t stand still to
And even if you don’t dance (don’t dance)
I gotta get you out and take this chance

[Verse 2]
I caught her cornering the pictures in her purse
A white reflection of the window of his hearse
And she knows not to be another wife in waiting
So she’s just a widow that I’m dating
Rolled up sleeves with a carton in it’s fold
A rusted chain with a cross that once was gold
And I look from a distance as the coffin closes
And disappears below the roses

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it like you ‘bouts to get paid
Ah, boom swaggaboom like you gots a peg leg (uh!)
Shake it, shake it like you ‘bouts to get paid
Ah, boom swaggaboom like you gots a peg leg

[Refrain]
This is for the CO, 3OH!3, my people
We got the music that you can’t stand still to
And even if you don’t dance (don’t dance)
I gotta get you out and take this chance
This is for the CO, 3OH!3, my people
We got the music that you can’t stand still to
And even if you don’t dance (don’t dance)
I gotta get you out and take this chance (no, you don’t)

[Outro]
Oh, I want you to dance again (don’t dance)
Oh no, don’t dance
Can we dance again? (don’t dance)
You better not be dancing
Oh no, don’t dance
