[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I smell it on your blouse
You’ve been seeing someone else so...
Go fuck yourself
Fix the lipstick on your mouth
Before you come into my house and...
Go fuck yourself
If it helps to see it clearer
Yeah, you can use a mirror...
To fuck yourself
Yeah, I smell it on your blouse
You’ve been seeing someone else so...
Go fuck yourself

[Verse 1]
You should try to be a bit more secretive
This isn’t how two people live
You take and take, I try to give
You’re always on that negative
Well, I don’t see no positive
We live in that zero
Next time you leave the house
Just keep your cell phone near you
I don’t wanna talk about it
I don’t need to take this
I’m a free spirit and you know that I’m spontaneous
Why you always tie me down?
You must be delirious
You think I’m fucking all your friends?
Nat, you can’t be serious!

[Chorus 2]
I can taste it on your tongue
You’ve been sleeping with someone so...
Go fuck yourself
You go out behind my back
Like I don’t know where you’re at...
So go fuck yourself
I bet you gave a hummer
In the backseat of his Hummer...
So go fuck yourself
I can taste it on your tongue
You’ve been sleeping with someone so...
Go fuck yourself

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I only trust your friends
Just as far as I can throw ‘em
Actually, fuck your friends
I don’t even know ‘em
When grown men are texting you
Saying that you owe them
Can you really put the blame on me when I follow where you go, then?
I don’t wanna talk about it
Why you think I’m shady?
I go out on the town ‘cause I’m a high-class lady
Why you try to lock me in?
You know you’re not my husband
This house is like a prison
Sean, you must be buggin’

[Outro]
Girl, did you go out?
Or did you stay in?
Textin' with my best friend
Plotting how to fuck him
Laughin’ with your girls
Like I don’t know nothing
I never knew that she could ever be so cold
Watch me as I fall apart, d-d-domino
Did I suspect?
Did I think that you would cheat?
Is the Pope Catholic?
Do wolves kill sheep?
Are there stars in the sky?
Is there water in the sea?
(Yeah, I think it’s safe to say I thought that you would cheat)
Well, guess what? Little Birdy gonna fly free
And guess what? Little Birdy won’t phase me
And when the truth comes out Little Birdy’s mouth
Little Birdy better pack her shit and fly South
Go fuck yourself, ha
Yeah, go fuck yourself
Go fuck yourself
Yeah, go fuck yourself
