[Verse 1]
This town used to be a pretty place to stay
A place you'd stop off on the highway
But all of those things changed on the day
You packed up your bags
And you ran away
All they say is how you've changed
Everyday I stay the same

[Pre-Chorus]
So you can keep the necklace that I gave to you
I'll keep the shitty tattoos

[Chorus]
I can see it from the other side
The grass isn't always this green
Our house is burnt to ashes
I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P, R.I.P
You and me
I can see it from the other side
The grass isn't always this green
Our house is burnt to ashes
I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P, R.I.P
You and me

[Verse 2]
I count the empty bottles upon the bar
But I give up, I can't count that far
The lights in this place are too dim to see
They're kickin' me out
It's a quarter past three
They tell me you're all I've got
I just need these dreams to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
So you can keep the necklace that I gave to you
I'll keep the shitty tattoos

[Chorus]
I can see it from the other side
The grass isn't always this green
Our house is burnt to ashes
I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P, R.I.P
You and me
I can see it from the other side
The grass isn't always this green
Our house is burnt to ashes
I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P, R.I.P
You and me

[Bridge]
In the back of the car
On the way to your home
In the pouring rain
On the side of the road
In the light of the street
In the recline of the seat
You told me I should move on
In the back of the car
On the way to your home
In the pouring rain
On the side of the road
In the light of the street
In the recline of the seat
You told me I should move on

[Chorus]
I can see it from the other side
The grass isn't always this green
Our house is burnt to ashes
I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P, R.I.P
You and me
I can see it from the other side
The grass isn't always this green
Our house is burnt to ashes
I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P, R.I.P
You and me
