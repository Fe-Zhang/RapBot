Fallen, fallen!
Here we stand wrapped up in our crimes
It’s all of us who are afflicted
It’s all of us convicted

All’ve fallen!
All’ve fallen!
The verdict call is “Guilty!”
Here we stand all wrapped up in our crimes

It is all of us who must surrender
We’re the culprit and the lone offender
With the gavel striking down upon our crimes
Upon our crimes
Upon our crimes

The guilty running free
Without a single thought of Your grace
Erring without a plea
In our sin, spitting in Your face

It’s all of us who are afflicted
It’s all of us convicted

It is all of us who must surrender
We’re the culprit and the lone offender
With the gavel striking down upon our crimes
Upon our crimes
Upon our crimes

Here rise the swelling waves
Exposed and helpless
It surely is our graves
Our hearts in distress
And as the waters caved
Falling from their slope
Our lives were truly saved
And given true hope

You held back the coming flood
And then You let it fall on Your Son
This debt was bought with blood
And in Your death our victory won
Held back the coming flood
And then You let it fall on Your Son
This debt was bought with blood
And in Your death our victory was won

You held back the coming flood
(The coming flood)
This debt was bought with blood
(Bought with blood)

It is all of us who must surrender
We’re the culprit and the lone offender
It is all of us who must surrender
We’re the culprit and the lone offender
With the gavel striking down upon our crimes
Upon our crimes
Upon our crimes

Under that tidal wave of wrath
Our guilty souls stand
It should have fallen on us all
But by Your command
Held back the crashing flood of wrath by Your hand

We are the ones who are afflicted
We are the ones who stand convicted
For all of us You were afflicted
For all of us You stood convicted
