[Verse 1: Listener]
Yeah, when you get up today to find me not around your place
Crying, realizing the events of days passed
Years creeping by in the minutes of forever
Deep impressions depressing into your heart
Asking the why's and how's, contemplating the start of your end
Remembering late nights with friends
Breath, grasping for the sides
Reaching for a plateau that spins not, I'm so sorry
I will not have meant to go, but I hope you know
That through all the sorrow and hurt that I'm better
I know it sucks to hear how I'll be all better
I try my hardest while I'm alive to get the most done
It doesn't make any sense though when death takes you for a run
It's all to keep the memory of me locked deep into your arteries
Harder to leave, just can't believe that through all the
Accomplishments and memories that none of it matters
The world keeps going, life keeps showing
How minute it is in the grand scheme of this, so
When tomorrow comes and you have to wake without me
Just make sure it's the life in me that you miss

[Hook]
So this is goodbye, so this is how they say it

[Verse 2: manCHILD]
I backslapped my clock in the face
At the same moment, pull seconds from the trash heap because I got no time to waste
Chase the sunrise, yell frantically as my tongue ties
Arguing that starting without me just might be unwise
Lungs try to take in oxygen, my jaw drops in astonishment
Heart breaks, time quakes like Kurt Vonnegut
Wisdom of Solomon drips from my split lip like collagen
Romancing the stone cold faces of death like Harlequin
Sew my stitch in time with silver threads and golden needles
Ignore the cold and evil and consider my life an opus
I focused on the process regardless of the outcome
Possessed the only copy of Sintax's solo album
These are the same hands that I used to stroke your soul with
Grabbed the city by the throat but didn't have the strength to hold it
If I'm ancient by tomorrow, I'll just step to the other side
Leave this dance in the capable hands of Deepspace 5

[Hook]
So this is goodbye, so this is how they say it

[Verse 3: Playdough]
16 pads for the drum, that's where I'm from
Wondering how I've become so accustomed
To the shoulder with a chip, the soul with a fat lip
My spirit's being smacked and character still attacked
The fact clearly remains they choose to not use
Because of mic sparks, permanent marks and tattoos
They act fools with rules of no piercings
And clearly it's pierced my soul, the biggest hole is in my heart
I'm wishing that tomorrow would start without me
Maybe then they'd see this emcee
Plays more of a solution to pollution to youth
But the truth is being masked with don't tell or ask
About hurts and lies from shirts and ties
Because it heavily relies on me wearing disguise
It's just to reach the lost; the cost is placing my arms crossed
On my chest, lay my body to rest and say goodbye

[Hook]
So this is goodbye, so this is how they say it
