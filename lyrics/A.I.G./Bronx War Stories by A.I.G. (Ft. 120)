[Verse 1: 120]
I'm fucked up, most brothers don't have it like me
Like my brothers in the P doing half a century
See God I know it's hard, black stay in your zone
Big Just we lost touch see you when you get home
And my man Stan just got back from doing ten
On some bullshit, now his ass is back up again
Wait, Ned did 9 straight, came home knocking cats out
Playing what's that all about, aiyo
You gotta maintain killer, I wanna put you on
So you could be a tee big armed guerilla
And to my peoples in the struggle
When everyday is a hustle so nobody move a muscle
'Cause Kelly got popped from her man
Both found dead, Money still had the pistol in his hand
Power Rules all up in my building selling crack
And kids around my way they just don't know how to act
Like my little man stole drugs got some kids fed
And Ted found him dead with a bullet to his head
Baby brother to my man Van, but life gotta go on
You still got me in the God Born
And what's his name dies from AIDS
Mom Dukes out of commission from breaking both her legs
Yo the inner city life controlled by the outer world G
Another Bronx War Story

[Chorus: 120]
Sometimes I have to search for information to find out
Why was we put in these certain situations
The inner city life controlled by the outer world G
Another Bronx War Story, Another Bronx War Story
Another Bronx War Story, Another Bronx War Story
Another Bronx War Story

[Verse 2: Darkim Be Allah]
Peace C God you held me down like a weapon
The fam I ran with born the ghetto legend
Big shot is set on and dead on KingPin
You and Big Just kept mad bells ringing
'Cross town niggas still frying I hold it down
Lord niggas ain't with all the shit we was down for
I'm still struggling, bubbling for paper
The herds like back in the day to pull a caper
The takers, now I got a plan to expand
Put it short, import/export to foreign lands
Stand forever like birds of a feather
Together whatever if niggas flip that's clever
The weather change but the style still remains the same
Who's to blame with the neighbourhood fame
I knew the game since the days that I played as a shorty
Another Bronx War Story

[Chrous: 120]
Another Bronx War Story
Sometimes I have to search for information to find out
Why we was put in these certain situations
The inner city life controlled by the outer world G
Another Bronx War Story, Another Bronx War Story
Another Bronx War Story, Another Bronx War Story
Another Bronx War Story
