They say jellyfish are lazy
But I don't think their lives are that crazy
Soft-bodied sea creatures
Showing off their curvy features
They don't seem to give a fuck
Swimming around, testing their luck

I'd like to be a jellyfish
It's a dream of mine, my only wish
We're all just animals
Living meaningless lives with unachievable goals
Why can't we be like the jellyfish?
Gelatinous creatures who don't give a shit
Veil-bodied bitches, they'll leave you with stitches

I try to justify my life by convincing myself of complex lies
Why can't I just be free?
Like these fish made of jelly

I'd like to be a jellyfish
I'd like to be a jellyfish
Why don't you be a jellyfish with me?
