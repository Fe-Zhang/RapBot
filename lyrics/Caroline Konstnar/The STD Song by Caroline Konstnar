[Verse 1]
When you're hanging with the girl
And she's looking nice
You think you'll wanna smooch her face
But what is the price?
AIDS, herpes, gonorrhea
Scabies and crabs
Think you want them down your pants?
No you raging ****

[Verse 2]
Now this shit has, really hit
And I feel like James Dean
But don't let that distract
From all these violent STDs

HPV, HIV
Spooky vaginosis
Sinning with your naked bod
Is evil and atrocious

[Bridge]
Time is a construct we all follow
Nothing is real, no one is here
We all die, why do we cry?
I once f****d a man
I can't feel my hands
I can't, I can't feel my hands!
Please!

[Outro]
AIDS, herpes, gonorrhea
Scabies and crabs
Think you want them down your pants?
No you raging ****
HPV
HIV
Spooky vaginosis
Sinning with your naked bod
Is evil and atrocious
