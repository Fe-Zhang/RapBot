Sleep
Shit
Lack of motivation
Eating ass
Living fast
Sleep deprivation
Stomach hurts
Feeling worse
Trying not to cry a loud
Piss for fun
Now I'm done
Your mom was plowed
Don’t feel like
Writing down
Anything funny
But I still wanna make
That YouTube money
Wanna get dominoes
Share with a blonde hoe
But I can't find my phone
And she kinda said "no"
Why does my back hurt?
Now I want dessert
I don't care
In despair
Naptime
Nightmare
Took a dump
In a slump
I can hear the neighbors hump
Watched a movie
Looked at boobies
Now I’m kinda feelin' groovy
