Stripper Magician, a wonderful addition
To parties and funerals even police suspicion
I think there's something shiny behind your ear
I can also make your daughter’s virginity disappear

Take a look at my magic stick
It makes dreams come true with just one lick-
Flick
Pulling out these scarves like I pull out of your daughter
I'm a magic man, a real Harry Potter

Bibbidi-Bop and Alakazam
When I go to town, I bring diaphragms
Stripper Magician on a musical mission
I may have failed grade school but I still have ambition

For my next trick, I need a wire-coat hanger
This one's for the dads who didn’t mean to bang her
My magic hat is where I keep my tips
Safe from taxation, it's an easy trick

I call it tax evasion, plain and simple
The US government is the one that I swindle
Stripper Magician, making sexual transmissions
I may not pay my taxes but at least I have your digits

Pick a card, any card
And if your friend's in need, I'll make his penis hard
