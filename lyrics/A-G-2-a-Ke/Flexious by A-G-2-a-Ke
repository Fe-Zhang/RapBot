[G-Mone]
I sit back and write the many ways, niggas play theyself these days
Thinking it gets always, straight kicking it pop we drop
A nigga died from a couple of shots
Left a nigga house before we get the nasty Glocks, punks be barking for nothing
You ain't hard cause you dumping, that's exactly how niggas get fucked up fronting
Nigga what's up with your itch making me adapt, I want to react
To some ignorant shit, fool I can hear your click hyping up 'fore the drama hit
You sorry motherfucker boo-hoo, screaming ain't shit to lose
That's why you fiending for a nigga to do right, yo who the fuck you think you talking to
How could you be real first if you couldn't feel this, or for instance
How could you sit here with your steel and no clip, shit just don't mix
Shit so true might you start hating on this, but my rhyme won't miss a pass
Thinking sad I be just as bad, and introducing your ass to the body bag it's flexious

[Chorus - 2x]
Flexious in the limelight is precious
I got my mind tight, who gon' test it
If that's what your mind like
Let me help you get your mind right, you lose your life like

[G-Mone]
Damn niggas need to maintain, think about they paper mayn
That nigga that jacked you in 87, charge that shit to the game
You can't break life and get change, like them dollas
Less than inflects pain to the brains of our youth, but they scream and holla
I wanna always be able to get change for a decent dollas, as well you for me
They say when it's real nigga be real niggas, my homies give G game for free
Honestly y'all survive to this, cause some of y'all wanna feel me
But can't hear me I know it's hard, being traumatized and letting the drama slide
Ask father forgiveth my sins, please tip your chin
And mean it from deep within nigga, bow to your knees
Go on man, cause I can see that you ain't listening man
Ready to lose your life like damn, nigga like damn
Since that's what your mind like
Let me help you get your mind right, you lose your life like
Shit so true might you start hating on this, but my rhyme won't miss a pass
Thinking sad I be just as bad, and introducing his ass to the body bag

[Chorus - 2x]
Damn
You lose your life like, damn
Lose your life like...damn
Lose your life like-like...damn
