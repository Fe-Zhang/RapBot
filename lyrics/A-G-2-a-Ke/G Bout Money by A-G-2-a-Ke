Slip you miss, I can't resist to flip figgas
Bullshit trigger, I handle it go call a digger
Bigger thangs, move motherfuckers nigga
Bang cocaine, done blew your fucking brains killa

Stick it to dusted addicted ya, it's you they smell killer

It's quick as thrill I squeeze, as quick as a nerve sipper
Shit I'ma make you niggas feel G, on the realer
Hit this choke off this bomb ass smoke, you rolling with a

But do the opposite of this real shit, and get killed bitch
Stack em up definitely, try to guess who's next wanna test a G-B-C

Spit to the punch, and right in the pitch teller
Then gripped it and flicked it, and words fella
So please freeze, the I done told em about my cheese sayer

Lit ya hip to the smoke with ya, high as hell breather

Swinger, into the face of a murder-a
Bring her, make them hoes chose to believe her
Since she can't provide, I don't need her
Leave her quick as a cheetah to get velveeta see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
Saving one of your millions for Aaliyah, go home

Watch me flip this shit in a minute, get paid taker
