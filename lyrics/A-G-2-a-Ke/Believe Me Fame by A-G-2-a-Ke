[G-Mone]
Finally motherfucking nationwide, show me your true homies
Where the love be, posted at the club handing out c.d.'s
Can you believe these hoes, write dreams on loose leaf and roll
Beaming for position to figured the dark to spark and playa you need not vision
So many homies is missing, tripping
There's too many of my guys anticipating, sitting in prison
Waiting for a visit, as I'm sitting I wish you could hit this
St. Pauly girl with the lemon twist, knee high power in a high tower
Handling bidness shit, ain't never met a nigga like this
Happy we family, affiliated with players pimps hustlers in reality
Macking to drop, and in they face cause I like to rap a fucking lot
Wrapping rubber bands around a knot, stacking for bigger plans won't stop
Don't understand how you lose your life, with two bucks in the grand
By a trigger with a itchy hand, fucking up future plans
Smoking a Newport thang, just trying to maintain
It's all the same, call me homie if you got some drama mayn and need some energy

[Chorus - 2x]
Believe me fame
Won't see me on TV, talking bout he changed
Since G hopped in the mist of thangs
Why jealous, he mad at me
I'm trying to get just change the game, drive a nigga insane see
Explain we simple and plain, homie if you need me

[G-Mone]
Come and holla at G, M-O-N-E
Better ask em though, why no why that ain't me I replied
G-2-A-KE be deep if I fall, I know that my dogs gon' catch me
Jack these, but in any type of sit-i-ation try to get messy
They dugging you in the hall, thanks 'fore you can test my testes
Ay peep dog keep stuck in the wall after the brawl jamming, hoping you rest we
See there's no reason for me to stop being me, the way some niggas though
They shoot you away bro, mad at me cause I'm looking for longevity
Pimp I hear ya, if you blink now your vision might get clearer
Peace to F-A-C-E, a real nigga
Want us to put it down, take a trip to H-Town
In the Rap-A-Lot building in Lil' J office, beating around surround sound
88 keep the windows ready to break, with the bass on
I can feel it vibrate so how long will it take, for me to make the bomb no hesitation
To other thangs, all the haters is still the same
So call me homie if you got some drama mayn, while you maintain

[Chorus - 2x]
[G-Mone]
Homie love when you figure, hear they dumping nigga
I'ma deliver some'ing fuck it, fucking with my guidance
Wanna see how the river dumping
Make you lose some'ing for the crews fronting, bumping at the gums
Cause niggas like y'all coming out, get to buck and twist ya and then be on the run
And never mention that I got ya, did I miss ya
Nobody knows that I got the mack to bust, cause I fixed ya
To the pound nigga, I got your back and you got mine
Let's split a light to the fullest, fuck proof for a bullet
Let's kick it with the crew, and do what the fuck we wanna do
No ID so you know do you know who's, trying to sweat and blocking me
Cut my dub turn that motherfucking light off, and let me in the club
Can't change, smoking a black and mild to maintain
Simple and plain, I'm still the same
Call me homie, if you got some drama mayn

[Chorus - 3x]
(*talking*)
Won't change a damn thing niggas
It's all real, take this shit and ride on out
