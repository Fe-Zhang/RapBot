[Intro: Scarface]
Rap-A-Lot Crime Family presents, Interface
You've now entered the realm of mafia life
Where sight and sound illuminates the art of killing
And where murder is the way of life
In collaboration with the infamous Mr. Face
A New Millennium has brought forth A-G-2-A-Ke
Raised off hard times
Dedicated to the streets

[Skit: G-Mone]
Two motherfucking minutes
Tired of being fucking broke
Let's stick this mother fucker
*gun shots*
Yeah, everybody put your mother fucking hands in the air
And get the fuck on the ground
This is a goddamn robbery, oh yeah!

[Verse 1: G-Mone]
The money entice my pocket
Ain't this nine cocked? Better hurry up and unlock
That safe and stop the bullshit
What you tryna pull trick?
Pull the switch and everybody up in this bitch
I'm warning you, hear this
If i hear sirens, everybody dying
And if I'm lying; I'm flying
Better yet, ask him
*gunshot*
Shut the fuck up, I'm robbing this ATM
Bitch you better hang that phone up and fill this bag up
You put your head down and don't move
Do what I say and it'll be okay
Time's a tickin' on this two minute mission
And I'm 45 seconds in, hey!
Fuck the pin
I'm thinking I'm counting ends as soon as I getaway
Tell her don't play
Don't even act like you was finna touch that stack
I could you think I'd let you slip me ink
I should peel your cap
For that, you relax
And give me the good shit
Right now I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Fools get, stuck in cells
For real, right now, if I had to give up
I'd fuck everyone of you hoes before they take my ass to jail
I wanna be able to eat steaks
I'm tired of this hotplate; I want a stove
And Apple Jacks and milk with a refrigerator to keep it cold
Fo-sho me the money hoe
Jumped over the counter and slapped her in the back of the head to let her know
You moving to slow, she had to blow
Damn, I got 30 more seconds to snatch all the dough I can
Understand, I watch the clock nonstop, sticking to the plan
On the other hand, I came up
But let's get back to the getaway
Two minutes, and I'm up
And all you mother fuckers have a nice day
I'm out the door
What the fuck is you looking for?
Jumped in the vehicle
Pushing it, I got to get to where I got to go

[Hook: G-Mone]
At last, I'm on cash
Mash, take off my mask quick, I laugh
You ask a nigga why I did it
I hit a lick
Blast, slick on y'all ass
That's what y'all get
That shit is over with and past tense
I got looted

At last, I'm on cash
Mash, take off my mask quick, I laugh
You ask a nigga why I did it
I hit a lick
Blast, slick on y'all ass
That's what y'all get
That shit is over with and past tense
I got looted

At last, I'm on cash
Mash, take off my mask quick, I laugh
You ask a nigga why I did it
I hit a lick
Blast, slick on y'all ass
That's what y'all get
That shit is over with and past tense
I got looted

Punks!
