[G-Mone]
Woke up early, to my mama screaming get up
Die young, I'm out here hustling to better us
(boy you better get your ass up) I'm up, (go to school) man skip school
She's a fool I use to think, I'll take that five and go get dank
Right before I sneak a drank, I'll be out the do'
And left mom's a nice fat bank roll, in the dresser drawer
Shhh, let me count my do'
One...two...fo', like she didn't know
Was young and silly though, cause she knew what I use to do
Through the hood I'd clown putting it down, stealing motherfuckers sound
Smoking quarter pounds with my niggas
And bitches that can keep it wild when I'm around, what's up what
What is this shit, I'm getting older now I know what thangs suppose to be
The old B 28, and you done slid me 25 point 3
(naw man, I was just trying to see what was on your ki)
And see my cubes fool, don't belong to you they belong to me
So miss me with that bullshit, and give me the full shit
Hell I know my scale'll tell, the same story that your scale tell
But I'm about my mail, you know G nigga
Just because your train of thought, derailed figure you'd go

[Hook - 2x]
Selling dreams coming clean, diamond infested bezeltynes
That gleam, everytime light beams you fiends for that Rolex I just seen
Dreams, having a Lexus coach edition
Like I got a team means, I don't need your help to help me dream

[G-Mone]
Not having it, boy be on your gravity
Ask ma it's too much traffic, I despise moving
We move a lot rocks on blocks, who woulda thought
Your homies will be nationwide, with Rap-A-Lot
How did it feel, wrapping your first knot
Touching your first Glock uncocked, and loving the ghetto games
Remember we use to pop to the sky, but now it's a damn shame
Need not explain, it's cocaine I'm sorry it's part of the blame
To get cake I slang, so my family could make the change I had to make
But don't take my word on it, the Hennessy get you hurt on it
Think about it while you hop on the highway and swerve on it, I bet a bird on it
Easily see, it's funny how shit be
I got to pay to get it from you, but you wanna get the shit free from me
I keep it low key, you hold these fo' mo' G's
In the back if you crap when you roll these, I'll be fo' mo' G's
On my P's, spending my money just tripled like gold D's
Be like your eyes, shit got me woke up out this M-O-N-E-Y

[Hook - 2x]
[G-Mone]
Naw, make sure you never get the best of us
Trust, then what the fuck you got the best for luck
What, maybe you wanna try to test these nuts
Is you certain you wanna leave hurting, huh nigga what
Then I woke up and puffing, shit was all good
Plus didn't wanna wake up, was dreaming about the hood
Ahh hood, heard birds make actions peak louder than words
Hurry go serve me, how many's getting served
Can't visualize it's blurred, look flinch can't you pinched a nerve
Wake up homie your lights is on, and you parked on the curb
You burn, you sitting here dreaming bout some gold D's and a 'Burb-on
Hype in a box, jump you woke up and all that shit was gone
Oh snap this time, I need to get my mind back
I'm not gonna make a mill and relax, perhaps
I'd rather stack, so my whole family's living fat
Mayn, can you counter attack
The hood game nigga, fucking with your mainframe
Nigga it's the same game, been writing for a long time
While other niggas dreams like fiends, got swallowed with the wine
Just smoked up rhymes, I treat it like a crime why
Cause the nigga that's selling you dreams, is the nigga that's telling you lies
Seasons change people change, and thangs get rearranged
Even after sent me call me homie, if you got some drama mayn
Mayn got some'ing want us to stay away, hey what happened to all the love
Want everything that we worked so hard for, to get swept up under the rug

[Hook - 2x]
Uh-he-he-he-he-he-ha, he-he-he-ha
