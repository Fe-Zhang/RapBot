[Verse 1: Lil $oof'R]
Wassup with you rapper boys, thinking you're first in the race?
I don’t think that you should mess with me, you should just stay in your place
You know that I've been the emperor, I declare you a disgrace
My raps, they tripping you up, so you should probably check your lace
You say that I mumble, just look at yourself
I think you should put your mic up on the shelf
I'm thinking that you should retire, ’cause your rhymes are tired
Now everybody wish you well
I started and ended your career in seconds
I'm thinking that this is a curse and a blessing
You're thinking that you are the greatest, and I can't attain it
Well, you should just listen to NEVER
Sticks and stones, think they'll never hurt you
But my rhymes so fire, so you know my words do
When it comes to rapping, man, you know you're the worst, dude
Let me teach you a lesson, think you still need to learn, dude
What comes around, goes around, never gonna let a boy go now
Skinny Lettuce, this ain't even close to a showdown
You going down, mumbling, stumbling, crumbling
Now he's coming in, while you fumbling, like damn
You a weeaboo, I can see it through
Liking anime, anyway, get the pepper spray
I’m your dad, get in the car, c’mon vamonos
And I just ended your career, bitch, adios, damn

[Verse 2: Lil TickyTacky]
Ayy, yuh
Already know what's happening
You, already know
Skinny, Skinny
Skinny, I wonder why, that’s your name
It's something you'll never be, along with the fame
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the ’Tac
Bitch, I'll pull up to your house and attack
Now, I'm wondering why you ain't got flow
You ain't got time, this war is mine
Now you can't win, you're nothing, I'm something (ayy)
You'll be running like
"Oh no, TicTac, with the flow!"
Wait, let me set you straight
Gonna win this fucking race
Now shut your ugly face
Yeah, okay, you know I'm better
You say you're gonna beat me, but I get your girl wetter
She's gonna be at my house, you know I don't lie
But you 'bout to be fried
Weeaboo or otaku
I'm still gonna rock you
You're obsessed with Goku
Like, let me give you a low boo, oh shit

[Verse 3: Big Nug]
Nate, you're bland
Your rhymes are fake, kinda like your name
Saying you skinny, stop playing old memes
You acting like a king but we know you're a queen
You're gayer than me, boy, sit down
I'm rolling through your town
With a Glock, hit up your block
With your girl riding on my cock
Nate tryna diss me?
But you're just a little kiddie, now shut up
Saying you ain't a weeb, shut up
You're just a little bitch
There ain't even no hits to it
Shut the fuck up
TicTac and $oof'R straight up roasted you and toasted you
They put you in the dirt
Go and flirt with another anime girl online
Ain't got time for this
I'ma finish this mother fucking diss
That anime girl is a trap, bitch
This was my idea and I'm gonna finish it
I'm gonna fucking cause you to die from a heart attack
Oh, whoops, where'd your career go?
Honestly, I would say sorry, but whatever
I can hardly fucking compare you two, little bitch
I'm done with you, bitch

[Outro: Big Nug]
I said "bitch," twice
