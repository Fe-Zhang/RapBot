[Intro: Tyrese]
I’ma do everything in my strength to keep you near
Let’s go

[Bridge: Tyrese]
All the many days you were on my mind
Visions of me with you all the time
I do whatever puts a smile on my baby's face
My best friend and you can never be replaced

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yuh, yo
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, goin' overboard like the Amistad
Ringin' bells, it was 2012 back in ‘95
I made it out alive, now, finally, I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's stickin' to it like mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself, so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginner's luck
If you denyin' the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise, get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial decent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I’m prayin' God give me the strength

[Chorus: Main Event West]
It’s like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It’s like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I’ve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice
I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

[Bridge: Tyrese]
(Here in my life, just you and I)
What am I gonna do?
(Here in my life, just you and I)
My best friend and you can never be replaced

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
They say tomorrow’s not promised today
But today I promise if we don’t make our own way, somebody’ll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, Lord, help me please 'cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I’m bulletproof
Cockin' the Glock and aim and shoot
My future’s ever clear, a 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreamin' of better days, dreamin' of better pay
But we got our work cut out for us, so we better pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep
But if I die, I pray the Lord my soul to keep

[Chorus: Main Event West]
It’s like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It’s like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I’ve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice
I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

[Outro: Tyrese]
(Here in my life, just you and I)
(Here in my life, just you and I)
You can never be replaced
