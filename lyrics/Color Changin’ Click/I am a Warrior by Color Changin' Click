[Chamillionaire - talking]
Yeah it's color changin click camp
Can't have no koolade in ya blood
Can't ?? ya nails around here
Can't be scared to get ya hands dirty
Ya gotta talk wit a purpose and walk wit a purpose
Theres a fine line between conceited and sir cockiness
So when a nigga tell you you ain't the man
You gotta tell em shut the hell up nigga
Stand back, I got this

[Hook - Yung Ro and Chamillionaire]
I am a warrior, I am a warrior (yeah who you with man)
Color changin army, color changin army (I can't hear you)
I am a warrior, I am a warrior (yeah)
Color changin army, color changin army

[Chamillionaire]
-Chamillitary mayne yeah
When this teams, spitting
Six-teens this means, it's dreams
You must be havin you think, you messin with this king
Or his team, forgetting that this team do big things
Get green split cream, and it sound like chu-ching
Yeah it's true Chamillitary is king of this team
But this means if ya ever wishing
That this team splitting, uh ya havin a sick dream
Forgetting that this team, is shadow under his wing
I'm spitting as much ballin, but I still got a bling bling
Watch the watch sing, be like bada bing bada bling
I'm still chamillitary the down south don king
I ain't gotta fight, til one of my soldiers off of that ring
Ya bound to get hurt, bound to dround in the dirt
And show a hater the true meaning of being down to earth
Theirs been a lot of controversy surrounding the kid album
Then drop on a two-two's with my vehicle did
Koopa

[Yung Ro]
-Yung Ro
Ay play ya part foot soldiers til ya mission is up
Just listen to us, and learn how we gettin these bucks
Ain't wishin for luck, it's crazy how these hit's comin up
Fuckin wit us pointless, like being high pissed in them cuffs
Gettin this bucks, is light weight rippin it up
Ain't like the order of the game, now we switchin it up
I'm like the feelin when ya first slide ya dick in the slut
And you smell like virgin pussy, I'm fixin to bust
And when my game get to swormin, niggas rang the alarm n
Get the fuck outta here cause color change is the army
I'm a mutha fuckin warrior, peep my scars
And I know I wouldn't be a warrior, without a war
So I'm a fight through it all, eatin tryna get full
Got the heart of a lion, to above a pitbull
I'm in nobody land so come try me bitch
We R-A-W the grimiest
NOBODY!

[Hook - Yung Ro and Chamillionaire]
I am a warrior, I am a warrior
Color changin army, color changin army

Color changin army, color changin army

[Rasaq]
-Uh Rasaq yeah yeah
Salute me, or shoot me
Theres no eatin for free
I eat wit the, intentions of obesity
Fat as a mobster, snackin on pasta
Chain on my neck so heavy, that my backs changin it's postier
Every nigga hope they don't wait on my roster
And you still need ya homies to spot you nigga
Boys is obselete, can not compete
We rock the streets, without puttin rocks on the streets
Just rocks on the teeth, rocks on the peice
Hot as the heat, that lay under the bottom of seats
We bring drama to beats, karma for freaks
I mean what I speak, this carasine lost in the heat
This is rock ya to sleep, kiss on the cheek
Piss on ya sheets, shit on ya teeth
Sit on you dicks, like a boogie at school
Wit wats full of his drool, this little nigga's a fool
Take a look for the sylables, and get him to do
Ay Cham get him to school, this nigga's a fool

No smirks no smiles no sleep no slack
Execute gonna defeat, reatreat then come back
You hungry then eat, I'll check m.r. he pack that
This meals ready to eat, ain't no season with that
You a freak that distract, and leap on ya sack
Get stacks, freaks ain't bout jackin
Through back that lac, keep the motive that static
If ya expression show happy or sad (relax)
We are not the get along gang or the care bear club
Please get in your brain, that theres no love
It's simple and plain, I have no hugs
You think this is a game?
Since there will be snakes and fake hand shakes
Go ahead shake his hand (but make sure his hand breaks)
Chamillitary get dough, but don't fuck with them cakes
Sloppy joe ass niggas, or any man which
Twitch like a damn chick, act like a damn bitch
Go gather brains quick
-50 the fucker has spoken
Do you understand the words that are coming out my mouth?
Soldier get out my face, now!
