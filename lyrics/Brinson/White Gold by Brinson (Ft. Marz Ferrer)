Even when the sun goes down
We'll find our way with the stars
When everything else grows cold
We'll keep burning brighter than white gold
We glow we glow we glow
Brighter than white gold
We glow, we glow, we glow
Brighter than white gold

[Verse 1: Brinson]
Greater is He that is in me that he that's in the world
My first bar was a scripture just to tick off the world
Dude I'm not of this flesh
I'm not of this world I been sent by the best
I don't know what you heard I do this for real, shhh, put them rumors to rest
I gotta fight off opinions of weak men
Replace the hate I can't let it sink in
When I seek Him it's not just the weekend
Christian Rap is my profession, LinkedIn
They like â€œhey, yo, who let them sheep in"
We really lions but that's our secret
Flood gates open living water seep in
Check the weather channel it's Tsunimi season
Lord help me get outta my feelings
Lord willing I ain't trying to be the villain
They wanna bury me I'm trying to break the ceiling
They wanna kill it I'm trying to bring the healing
The game in a drought I came with provisions
I'm here with some scriptures im making incisions
Operating table savior more than able
To make us like diamonds and shine to the millions
You can't kill this hope, bruh
I keep getting doper
Even Jesus had Judas so don't pucker up when you 'bout to betray us
I know that it's coming but I know that He's coming
Til I see Messiah I'm gold in the fire I'm straight overcoming, Yea

Even when the sun goes down

We glow we glow we glow
Brighter than white gold
We glow, we glow, we glow
Brighter than white gold

[Verse 2: Brinson]
I do this for believers when the world don't believe us
It's a narrow road but we wide receivers
I'm running with the Rock that's another name for Jesus
I'm trying to rise like Jesus I ain't trying to hide this Jesus
I'm 24 karat when I share it
Point you to the sky like a building in Paris
Point you to the father like I never been embarrased
I never woulda made it if he never woulda beared (what)
Cross, crusifix, crown of thorns, side was pierced
Nine inch nails through the wrist, all for us he rose we Lit
We gonna glow when the others don't show up
They gonna know that the maker is for us
Burn slow gold the world can't hold us
We don't believe them lies that they told us
Lamborgini and the weed don't fulfil us
We don't need the codine and chichallias
Saved souls, A.K's can't kill us
I told some CRIPS Jesus blood gonna heal us
I glow different we are not the same
I flow different this ain't for the fame
Our goals different this all for His name
I'm trying to hear well done when He call my name

Even when the sun goes down

Brighter than white gold
We Glow, we glow, we glow
Brighter than white gold
