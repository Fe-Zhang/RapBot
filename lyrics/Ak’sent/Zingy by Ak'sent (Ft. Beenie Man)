Ey na na na na na na
Beenie Man
Ak'Sent

[Verse One]:
Di di di di da di do da di dum
Watch him come when I shake my bum bum i'm bad I said
You can catch me in my Dolce
Gabana mama gettin Prada on my off day
Me and my ladies put it down in the worst way
Hey and we know how to party
Hot steppin like that
And you don't want no problems cause my girls got my back yea
Dress to impress
Fresh to death still havin fun none the less
And we ain't worried about our hair
We pin it up or sweat it out we really dont care gurl
If you bought it it's yours
It doesn't matter if its a human's or horse's
A horse ofcourse
So put your drink down and get on the floor

[Chorus]:
Zing zingy zang za-zang za-zang zingy zingy zang zingy zingy za-zang za-zang zoom
Ladies, where you at where you at
Shake your zingy zang
Show him where you at okay

Zing zingy zang za-zang za-zang zingy zingy zang zingy zingy za-zang za-zang zoom
Ladies, where you at where you at
Shake your zingy zang
Show him where you at okay

[Verse Two]:
Di di di di da di do da di day
What you say when I come around your way
I can't hear you
Oh, you wanna be my man but my girlfriend said you told her the same thing man
Is that your game?
Is that the biggest line in your iddy biddy brain?
My ladies gettin tired of you suckers and you lames
Lookin for a hot boy to set fire to my flame
Yea, its a girls a-like thing
Acrylic nails, stilletos, slippers, and tight jeans
And we like nice things
Nice chains, nice rings, so we covered in bling
Ginseng for that ass if you tired of the swing
On my hips or the bounce of the dip just sit
And everything you want you can't get
Cause my legs sealed tighter than the kunfu grip

[Chorus]

[Hook]:
As we hit the door
Me and my girls hit the floor
Get the rhythm from the beat
Get the drinks from the bar
We got our hands in the air
All the females over here
Leave the dudes over there
It's the battle of the sexes
You know we gon' rep this

[Chorus x3]
Zing zingy zang za-zang za-zang zingy zingy zang zingy zingy za-zang za-zang zoom
Ak'Sent, collabo
Comin at you from the west
That's how we do it baby
Uh huh, westside yea

Ladies where you at
