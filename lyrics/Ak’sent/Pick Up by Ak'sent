Pick Up, Pick Up
Pick Up, Pick Up
I'm Callin, You, You, You-Ooh

Well I Never Woulda Known You Woulda Stopped Pickin Up The Phone When I C-C-Call
Now I'm Sittin All Alone In My Drop Kicks On, But I'm Feelin So C-C-Cold
Didn't Think You Woulda Left Me All Alone
Now I Can't Stop Leavin Messages At The Tone
All My Friends Say I Be Zoned Out When We Roll Out
I Be Actin Like I Be There On My Own
Think How When I Be Right, Why You Doin This To Me
You Be Actin Like You Never Ever Did Me Wrong
That Don't Make Me Right, But If You Feel Like What I Feel Like
You Could Neva Sleep At Night
When The Song Goes Uh-Oh I Don't Know The Reason
But That's When I Miss You The Most
And I Can't Let Go
Cuz Every Season I'm Seein Others On They Own Relationships
They Huggin And Kissin And I Can't Help To Feel Real Jealous
And I Tell You This If I Be With Another
It Won't Help Me Feel No Better
And If You Would Jus
Pick Up Your Phone I Would Get To Tell That I Love You
Please Jus, Pick Up The Phone Cuz We Belong Together

[Chorus]
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Boy I Need You (Pick Up, Pick Up)
I'm So Alone, Now That Youre Gone
Boy I Was Wrong, Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Cuz I Need You (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Jus Wanna Say That I'm Sorry
Couldn't Tell You So
Baby Please Forgive Me, Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin

When I Look Here Baby
Won't Stop Callin Till I Get You On The Line
Till I Get Through To Your Mind
Then Me Without You Is The Fine
You Can't Deny
The Kisses, The Champagne Wishes
The Bitches Sittin Ontop Of The Dresser
They Held Us Together, Despite Of The Weather
For Worse Or For Better & I Ain't Gotta Ring On My Finger
You Got Me Fallin Apart
Like A Gin Gon Do
If I Was Beyonce I'd Sing To You
It Should Be Destiny For Us To Have A Child Eventually
When The Time Was Meant To Be
Look I Ain't Tryin To Push You Away
Jus Remember The Days On My Arm You Would Lay
Cuddle And Hair Play
Everybody Love You When You Met My Family
You Know If My Daddy Was Alive Fit, Click With You
At First I Ain't Even Wanna Get Wit You
But You Broke It Down
Showed There Was More To You
Now You See That I'm In Love With You
Now I'm Thinkin I'm Goin Crazy Cuz
Crazy Is As Crazy Does
And I'm Standin Outside In The Pourin Rain
At The Phone Booth Think I'm Gonna Have To Go Sock Some More Change
I'll Call You Back

[Chorus]
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Boy I Need You (Pick Up, Pick Up)
I'm So Alone, Now That Youre Gone
Boy I Was Wrong, Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Cuz I Need You (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Jus Wanna Say That I'm Sorry
Couldn't Tell You So
Baby Please Forgive Me, Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin

So Now Who's Gonna Hug And Hold Me
Kiss Console Me, When I'm Lonely
Be My Homie, Keep Me Grindin When I Start To Trip
Calm Me Down When I Start To Flip
Put It On Me Till I Get A Twitch In My Hip
Bitin My Lip, Pullin With My Rib
Stay Up And Talk To Me After Its Over
Can't Belive That You Sayin That Its Over
But I Keep On Callin, Till I Talk To Ya
Damn I Feel As If I'm Stalkin Ya
Damn I Feel Like You Took My Heart With Ya
Boy Wish We Could Start All Over
But I Ain't Ever Wanna Let You Go
So I'm Callin To Let Ya Know
That I Ain't Ever Wanna Let You Go
That's Why I Called You To Let You Know

[Bridge]
Baby We Can Work It Out
(I Just Wanna See You)
We Got Things To Talk About
(I Know That I Hurt You)
I'm Reaching Out For Your Love
(I'm Sayin That I Need You)
And You're The One That I Wanna

[Chorus]
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Boy I Need You (I Need You) (Pick Up, Pick Up)
I'm So Alone (I'm So Alone), Now That Youre Gone (Now That Youre Gone)
Boy I Was Wrong, Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin (I'm Callin, Yeah) (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Cuz I Need You (I Need You, I Need You) (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Jus Wanna Say That I'm Sorry (I'm Sorry)
Couldn't Tell You So
Baby Please Forgive Me (Forgive Me), Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up) (Pick It Up)
Boy I Need You (I'm Callin, Yeah) (Pick Up, Pick Up)
I'm So Alone, Now That Youre Gone
Boy I Was Wrong, Pick Up The Phone
I'm Callin (Pick Up, Pick Up)
Cuz I Need You
