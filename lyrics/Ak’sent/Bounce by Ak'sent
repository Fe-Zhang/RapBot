(feat. Trillville)

It's da cutie Ak'sent mi crew b active
Game tight, face like a movie actress
What u dunno I'm in beauty pageants
Black tees blue jeans and da boots b matchin
Alright rock a wife beater wit da white sneakers
U like how mi frame shape kinda like Trina's
And I'm da right diva to sing dis song
And I'm never fallin off cuz mi team is strong
Please u gon bring it all wit da black thing in yo pocket
Ya'll musta seen mi car it's not da platinum but it's da black wun
I'm in da club drinkin and seekin some action
Cut boy wut u ain't ready fo dat
And da ice on mi neck is too heavy to smash
And da checks yeah thurr ready to cash
And errytime u hear dis song u better make da radio blast

Jus bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce it around
Turn it up turn it up when u hear mi sound
No time fo haters u can not shake her
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Jus bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce it around
Turn it up turn it up when u hear mi sound
No time fo haters u can not shake her
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her

Listen up watch me close u can't stop these flows
Mi watch look like a rocky road
Yea I talk about ice cuz u kno I make cream
Da onli way u stoppin dat is in yo daydream
And I will take lead over all ya'll dumb broads
And everytime I spit yea u kno I'mma come hard
Hate dat? I love it take dat end of it
I came to reign and I bring dat ruckus
Y'all came to hate but ya'll jus can't touch us
I came to stay like 8 straight summers
Prolli wit yo man sumwhurr livin it up
Got him comin out his pockets and I'm spending his bucks
Dun't hate dun git mad go git glad
Got em jealous when dey see me in dat OC Jag
An I'm gon kick back plus I'm gon git stacks
How u gonna do dat when I'm gon spit raps?

Jus bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce it around
Turn it up turn it up when u hear mi sound
No time fo haters u can not shake her
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her
Jus bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce it around
Turn it up turn it up when u hear mi sound
No time fo haters u can not shake her
Got mi hands up yes congratulate her

But u kno we keep it smooth
