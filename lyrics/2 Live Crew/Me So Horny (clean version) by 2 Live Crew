[Intro]
"What'll we get for 10 dollars?"
"Every 'ting you want"
"Everything?"
"Every 'ting.."

[Hook]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 1: Brother Marquis]
Sittin' at home watchin' Arsenio Hall
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the seven digits
Said, "Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?"
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for love, 'cause me so horny

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
Girls always ask me why I bug so much
I say "What's wrong, baby doll, with being a nut?
"'Cause my nature is rising, and you shouldn't be mad
"I won't tell your Mama if you don't tell your Dad
"I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your clothes all messed up
"Won't your Mama be so mad if she knew you've just been had?"
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is love, 'cause me so horny!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
You can call me desperate, even say I'm perverted
But you'll call me a dog when I leave you lost and deserted
I'll play with your heart and won't show no shame
I'll be blowing your mind 'cause you're lame to the game
I'm just like that man they call Georgie Puddin' Pie
I love all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a freak in heat, a dog without warning
I have an appetite for love, 'cause me so horny

[Hook]

Breakdown (Mr. Mixx scratches)

[Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice]
It's true, you were alone until you met me
I was the first to dress you up, and make you sexy
You tell your parents that we're goin' out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your arms around me and squeeze me, too
I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning
My appetite is love, 'cause me so horny

[Outro]
