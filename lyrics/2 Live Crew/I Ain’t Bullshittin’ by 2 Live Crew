Now what I’m gonna say I’m only say it one time and one time only...
The people who I do offend--if I offend you and you take it in a personal way then personally, I don’t give a damn
'Cause first of all what I’m gonna say now is gonna be very so true, I mean like very true
So, if you don’t like it, fuck you
Now I’m gonna tell you a little something about the little clique we aren't in. We’re not in, I mean, you know the cilque...we travel all around the world on tours with groups and they really don’t like us
You know, a lot of suckers talk a lot of shit about us, and a lot of bitches talk a lot of shit about us
So, uh, we say something like this here...

(Mr. Mixx scratches)

I ain’t Bullshittin’

Bitch wasn’t shit
I ain’t Bullshittin’
Straight over
And the Bitch wasn’t shit
I ain’t Bullshittin’
Bitch wasn’t shit

[Luke]
Now let me tell you a story about this kid, who has a record, who really likes talking to pipes- if you know what I mean
I mean, man, cuz only sold a hundred and fifty thousand strong
I mean, he need to get up on his own shit, instead of getting in Billboard talking shit about the 2 Live Crew...
You know who I’m talking about. I mean, man name is MC Shine...is his name Shine? What?
Fuck what his name is, I mean cuz don’t even know his ass from a hole in the ground
He got some fucked up Pumas on, I mean you know he ain’t getting paid shit, cause, uh…we can even see his feet
And you know something? My nigga...yo, scratch something for him

(Mr. Mixx scratches)

I ain’t Bullshittin’

Get that pipe out your mouth

One more time, tell him:
Bitch wasn’t shit

[Luke]
And now we wanna know who’s actually doin' it with the R...
I mean like, doin' it with the R? Who’s sucking the R’s dick? Somebody in New York who controls shows, and national tours, who don’t let us play on national tours...
They are sucking a certain person’s dick, a certain group's dick. One MC, and one DJ, and the initials of a name is...C.L
(Laughs) Y’all know 'em, we know 'em
Personally, I don’t give a fuck about the bitch

(Mr. Mixx scratches)

I ain’t Bullshittin’
And you know what I said?

[Luke]
I just want y’all to know one thing and one thing only...
We made this one record so it can get played in New York City
And I know it will get played in New York City, more times than you ever thought it would get played because we only talk about people who don’t like us
And for all you other one million people out there, we love y’all...
