[Sample]
I know a place just down there two streets
Babe they'll ask you no questions and give you clean sheets

[Luke]
Welcome to the funk shop!

[Fresh Kid Ice]
There's only one place where we can go
Where the price is right just to see a show
It's always popular with the girls and the guys
'Cause for all my money, it's the best buy
Ten dollars, two hours is the time of the stay
It's more than enough, time to slay
Each room has a bed and also a sink
So you can wash your body so it won't stink
But be careful of the things that you use
So you can won't arrested for sex abuse
So as you hit the door and the panties drop
Whole lot of rockin' and rollin' at the funk shop

[Brother Marquis]
Please come inside and make yourself at home
I want to funk so let's get it on
You little girl behind closed doors
You would feel the funk and nothing more
Now prepare yourself for the ride
Let me funk you all, black or white
'Cause I want to slay you if you're able
Don't fight the funk and don't be shameful
Bring out the ice cubes and the hot water
This is the second half and not the second quarter
I'll funk you 'til you sleep, you'll sleep like a baby
And in your dreams you'll say I'm crazy at the funk shop

[Luke]
You're in the funk shop, baby
I wanna see you bleed

In the funk shop, that's where it's at
In the funk shop, the place to splak
In the funk shop, where all the boys go
In the funk shop, funkin' all the hoes

Thank you for be funkin' at the funk shop!
