{Hook}
I'm trying to kick it tonight, (oh whoah)
So baby tell me what that thang smell like
I'm trying to kick it tonight, (oh whoah)
So baby tell me what that thang smell like

{Verse 1}
Hey girl what it hit for
We can get it on on the low low
In the back seat of a Volvo
Make it shake, make it jump, make it twerk
Up and down just 'cause a young playa said so
Basically, what the thang smell like is what I'm askin'
While the music blastin' in the background
See the bling from the wrist
Plus the game in your ear got you ready to bounce right now
But Ma hold on, it's just the beginning of the song
We can bounce in a little bit
'Cause the dime just walkin by caught a nigga eye
