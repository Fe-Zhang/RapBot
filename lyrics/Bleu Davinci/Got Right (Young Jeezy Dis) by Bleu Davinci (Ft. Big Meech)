[Intro: Bleu DaVinci]
I swear to God on my momma
This nigga shouldn't never have tried me, nigga
It's the nigga Bleu
I don't know why these niggas wanna wake up the motherfucking vampires
Been waiting, nigga, but I'm up
Finna bite these niggas back
They ain't finna come at me like that
That's on everything I love, nigga

[Big Meech]
That nigga just ain't right, man. I mean, he shitted on the whole fam

[Hook: Bleu DaVinci]
Pussy-ass nigga, I got right
Weak-ass nigga, I got right
Soft-ass nigga, I got right
What I'mma do to this nigga is not right

[Verse 1: Bleu DaVinci]
Go on and tell 'em what the truth is -- you's a bitch
Turned House in to the Feds, now who's the snitch?
I know you think you got the upper hand
Can't even say a nigga name -- less than a man
I remember when your ass played the background
Scared to push a bag, trying to give it to Mac Town
Wanted to be me so bad, you started wearing Dickies
And trying to bang, but your weird ass just looking silly
And I'm the nigga that gave you your affiliation
I'm the nigga that involved you in the precipitation
Now it's time for retribution, reciprocation
Now them shots been fired? Homie, I was waiting
You could hide behind a couple plaques
But every shooter that's with me hold a couple straps
Catch your ass down bad at that awards show
And blow your pussy ass out your dress clothes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bleu DaVinci]
Now let me get down to the meat of things
Quit all that flexing -- you know they took your chain
Call my phone crying, talking 'bout some brooking niggas
That night I spared your life; you was in the midst of killers
Got some info that'll leave your whole career dead
Like that Porsche and that 'rari you turned in to the Feds
And I was wondering how you skated a mob indictment
Guess them people found a friend in you -- yeah, they liked 'im
Yeah, I fucked your bitch, but the pussy was trash
Now I'm 'bout to go bananas on your monkey ass
Pussy nigga, why you coming at me?
Need to try to get some money back from Kinky B
Twin ain't fucking with you, Coach done kept it moving
Guess they wasn't that gay shit your ass was doing
Stealing niggas' money, but you claim that you're loyal
And here, I got them three letters' walking papers for ya

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Meech]
Gibbs be on that shit Jeezy was on, you know what I'm saying? That's why ain't nobody never came after him. That nigga's stupid. He keeps screaming "Gangsta Gibbs," and they ain't heard a song from him yet
