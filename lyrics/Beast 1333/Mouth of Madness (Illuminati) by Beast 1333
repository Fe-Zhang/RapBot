[Verse 1]
Worshiping Jesus, praising Allah, they praying to Buddha
It's a holy war in the age of computers
Revenge of the Arabs, Castro probably dying in Cuba
His brother through marriage, his destiny is Raul the ruler
The English is with us, North Koreans testing the waters
They sons and they daughters
Are training for American slaughter
The planet is hotter, getting hotter, hotter than lava
If I had a dollar for every time they mention Osama
The wicked are winning, the cunning are coming
They hummin', out gunnin'
The Jews are dropping bombs and they blowing up hundreds
Chavez is tripping, Venezuelan oil conglomerate
Up in Alaska the pipeline is polluting the continent
Hell with the Vatican, Benedictus conflict with faggots is
He don't want them changing or arranging up marriages
Babies in carriages, twisted by domestic disturbances
Urgent emergencies freakin' all your neighbors and urban kids
Hell with they purposes, gasoline is peaking and rocketin'
Is the Arab and Israeli conflict really the problem?
Just look at Obama, he shares an ancestor with Cheney
We living in horror, the television wiling for ratings
I'm tired of waiting, I got a feeling something gon happen
Ain't nobody skating, I dreamed about the splitting of atoms
I really can't fathom the chemicals our food is containing
They grabbing our children
And sticking them up in basic training
It's so entertaining to witness all these millions of people
Just gather together and worship all those symbols of evil
Let's start an upheaval, and gather in our secret societies
There's something primeval inside of me that craves notorietyâ€“shit on your blessings
They tortured me in school with they lessons, and sat me in front of a man, and made me give him confession
This country's oppression's got us going through a recession
Your worldly possessions will all be taken soon with discretion
They killing in Burma erasing more than half of they populous
Choppers is drifting across the Gaza strip, and they mockin' us
People are screaming, the gun it bucks and scatters its metal
You know you ain't dreamin', it's just another day in the ghetto

[Verse 2]
Okinawa Hiroshima pulmonary emphysema
Soldiers up in Iwo Jima didn't need no help from FEMA
Chosen men with battle scars, galactic rhyme your battle star
Poison rays that travel days
There's many ways to land on Mars
Now they killing us with cars cause they overlook the fumes
Baby food that comes in jars fed to infants causing doom
Hit the lights and leave the room, people running in the street
Armageddon coming soon, microchips control your sleep
Scan your wrist and pay your debts, the sky is full of flying jets
Mixing clouds with chemicals, amazing we ain't dying yet
Every time you wash your hair or brush your teeth you dying quick. Every time you eat a hunk of steak and take a giant shit
Every time you feed your kids I bet there are preservatives
And every time their major plan is always trying to murder us
The streets is full of mercenaries waiting for they time to kill
Worshiping the pyramid that's found upon the dollar bill
I hope you understand for real, again I'll never say it
We only have till 2012 before they come in spaceships
