If you ain't getting money, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't fuck no bitches, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't counting guala, what the fuck you doing?
I'm worried about nada, what the fuck you doing?
And I just left the scene, I pull off in an Astrid
The fetty do a rope, that's look I make it back for
If you ain't chasing paper, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't counting money, what the fuck you doing?

[Verse 1]
I grew up on the block, I never had no cheese
I never had no money, eat in Mickey D's
I might sleep with a broad, then I shake her piece
No I don't speak your language, I speak no English
If you ain't chasing money, what the fuck you doing?
My people sending money, need that worse than you
I seen the feds watching, I make no [?]
Rather get me head until I catch a contusion
My partner told me, yo play the game right
My name is Jeff Chery, get that name right
You niggas act stupid, if I don't aim right
You might catch a shell in broad day on the same day

[Hook]
If you ain't getting money, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't fuck no bitches, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't counting guala, what the fuck you doing?
I'm worried about nada, what the fuck you doing?
And I just left the scene, I pull off in an Astrid
The fetty do a rope, that's look I make it back for
If you ain't chasing paper, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't counting money, what the fuck you doing

[Verse 2]
My nigga, what you ding if you ain't chasing paper?
Now shawty popping Xans, told her meet me later
I'm back up on a clip, know they candy races
I'm smoking hella dope, man I feel sedated
So if you wanna know what the fuck I'm doing
I'm bumping [?], shout out to computers
Free Bobby Shmurda, that young'n the truth
And fuck the cops, they just wanna open loose
You keep it real, I been grinding for a minute
What I'm doing? Chasing money, to all my niggas chilling
Had to get about it, that's the side, you off for a victim
Until I see that Phantom Ghost brand new, red whip

If you ain't getting money, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't fuck no bitches, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't counting guala, what the fuck you doing?
I'm worried about nada, what the fuck you doing?
And I just left the scene, I pull off in an Astrid
The fetty do a rope, that's look I make it back for
If you ain't chasing paper, what the fuck you doing?
If you ain't counting money, what the fuck you doing
