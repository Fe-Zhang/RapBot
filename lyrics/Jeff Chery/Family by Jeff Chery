[Intro]
That's a lot of swag, that's a lot of swag
Dead bodies keep on haunting me
Every night, every night
My head, yeah, do it for my family

[Hook]
Niggas real, some niggas fake, ain't what I wanna be
Fuck with fakes, I'mma regulate, I call up Warren G
Every night all these dead bodies keep on haunting me
Out of sight, out of mind, do it for my family
Quarter lick, credit card, feeling like a super star
Super clean, I got wings all up on my denim jeans
Every night all these dead bodies keep on haunting me
Out of sight, out of mind, do it for my family

[Verse 1]
Interstate, on that interstate, I'm on that interstate
Flying out with a groupie bitch, I got like call to make
Plenty money all up in my jeans, but I got more to make
I be moving a lil, lil ki, I count 'em for the 8
A lot of swag, that's a lot of swag, got lot of swag
If she want, and I kill the pussy, that's a shopping bag
Remember the days, I was in her hood with a hockey mask
Extended clip, infrared on, let's play laser tag
Hustle hard, gotta hustle hard, you niggas counterfeit
All my hoes super fine birds, they got that ostrich bitch
Every day, I don't watch my back, my niggas never slip
Big wheels sit up on the curb, car never flip

[Hook]
Quarter lick, credit card, feeling like a super star
Super clean, I got wings, all up on my denim jeans
Niggas real, some niggas fake, ain't what I wanna be
Fuck with fakes, I'mma regulate, I call up Warren G
Every night all these dead bodies keep on haunting me
Out of sight, out of mind, do it for my family

[Verse 2]
Haitian king, I'm a Haitian king, yeah I'm a Haitian king
Bottle flow, shout out Kodak Black, that's a Haitian thing
Took a plane, land in Port-au-Prince, I had a Haitian fling
Wrap the Haitian flag around my gun, I'm shooting Haitian flames
Double day, oh I double day, you players make a move
Flagrant foul, up and down the court, no I don't play with you
Shop calls, I'm a moving race so fuck a sleeper too
You niggas sweet, candy bars sweet, that's a vapour roof

[Hook]
Quarter lick, credit card, feeling like a super star
Super clean, I got wings, all up on my denim jeans
Niggas real, some niggas fake, ain't what I wanna be
Fuck with fakes, I'mma regulate, I call up Warren G
Every night all these dead bodies keep on haunting me
Out of sight, out of mind, do it for my family

[Outro]
A lot of swag, nigga, that's a lot of swag
I kill the pussy, that's a shopping bag
In the hood, yeah, how he bags
Extended clip, by the waist, playing laser tag
