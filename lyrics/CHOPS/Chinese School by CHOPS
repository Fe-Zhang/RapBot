Never seen Charlie Chan
Never forget Vincent Chin
I'm 'bout to drop some knowledge on you
Let the lesson begin
Now, I'ma teach this assignment in slang
Brother, change the whole world to see shit
Like The Eye by the Pang brothers
Asian American who ain't afraid to say
Comparing me to David Carradine
Will get you set ablaze with kerosene
I don't call television racist
But I do watch The Simpsons and SpongeBob just to see some yellow faces
I take the yellow haters down like elevators
Left hand on your girl, right foot on the accelerator
You ain't laughing at that
I'm that new type of Asian
I'll let you do the math on that one
I'ma teach you who's me cause I'm the Bruce Lee of loose-leaf
The Donnie N. of rhyming, and the Jackie Chan of rapping, man
Orient Express coming through!
Forget what you think you know
I'll teach your ashes a lesson
Listen and learn and don't ask me no questions
Wake up, kids, and keep your eyes in my direction
Welcome to my Chinese school
Class is in session
