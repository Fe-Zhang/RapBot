Tell me babe, how many times do I shed my tears?
Every heart, every heart is not a gentle yet
Shall I do, I can never say my loneliness
Every heart, doesn't know so what to say or what to do

Was afraid of darkness cause I felt that I was left alone
So I prayed for help to distant million stars

Round and round the planets revolve around the sun
And we always seek after love and peace, forever more
Growing, growing, woah baby, we can work it out
Look up at the sky, every heart is shining on today

Show me now, what kind of smile do I come across
Every heart, every heart can take a step towards the dreams
All of us, what to take a lasting happiness
Whenever you feel sad, I wanna hold you and give you a sound sleep

Someday every heart's gonna be free and easy
We have peace of mind
Someday all the people find the way to love

Goes and goes, the time goes on we are not alone
We live on together and we will find some precious things
Sometime we will smile sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believing yourself, tomorrow's never die

There is the warm heart places on my mind
In my earliest day's there and it's so sweet
There are many stars they have talk with me so kind
They say yes always time's a friend of mine, so shine

Round and round, the planets revolve around the sun
And we always seek after love and peace forever more
Growing growing, woe baby we can work it out
Look up at the sky every heart is shining all today

Goes and goes, the time goes on we are not alone
We live on together and we will find some precious things
Sometimes we will smile sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believe in yourself, tomorrow's never die
