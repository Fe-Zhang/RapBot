(Verse 1 -Squeak Ru)
It go down, bam
How you like me now
Squeak from the Westside, quick to buck em down
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, here I come
The Fat Man cappin wit the double barrel gun
Niggas better run from the maniac (prisoner ?]
Or I'm gettin ya, folks is straight [???]
And fucked [outta ?] church, now I got ya [restin ?]
And ya best hittin switches in a hearse
Burstin from the brain, this it's insane
Hoo-bang, 45 reasons to make your flesh hang
Sketch ya up to wet ya up
And shoot ya up, what you gon do now, nigga
I got to casket ya
Hit the cut or get the you-know-what
Fool, I'm down to bust cuz I can't get enough
Squeak comin rough and I'm fuckin niggas up, nigga
(Fuckin niggas up, nigga)
Uh, don't you know that...

Chorus:
Caps get peeled on the regular, on the regular, on the regular, on the regular
Caps get peeled on the regular, on the regular, on the regular, on the regular

(Verse 2 -Squeak Ru)
Caps get peeled on the regular
When I fuck around and get hardcore
Nigga, you can't reach my level
I beat the shit out the devil
Witta [shovel ?], fuck a rebel
The suicidal muthafuckin menace
Leavin nuttin but bones and ya skull when I'm finished
You better hide when I hoo-ride
Bustas bringin drama, I'ma loosin off ya chestsize
Wit these hollow point tips
The shit that I'm totin is [???] wit the 50 clip
You can't fade me, nigga tryna daze me
Muthafucker, what's wrong wit you, is you crazy
Fuck wit Squeak that all [she wrote ?]
My family tree ain't shit but killas and cutthroats
That [???] outta the gates and [???]
Ready to bail
The creature that'll beat ya is down [to give em shell ?]

Chorus

(Verse 3 -Squeak Ru)
Niggas better watch they step
I might be the craziest muthafucker you ever met
I retaliate for respect, fuck a wreck
Step and I break yo neck
That's how the fuck I'm comin
Don't get mad if you catch me up in your woman
No love is how you treat a hoe
And you bitch made niggas y'all gots to go
That's right, I can't stand it
Ain't enough room for me and you on the planet
Ain't no way for you to top my flow
Squeak Ru from the land of the hunnit spokes, muthafucker

I pledge allegiance to the rag of the United Westside Connection
And the W for which it stands, one neighborhood under god
Y'all know the rest...

Chorus
