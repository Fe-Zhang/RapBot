(Verse 1 -Squeak Ru)
In the county jail I'm straight  catchin hell
Facing strike number 3, goin crazy in my jail cell
Goddamn, I think I'm through
They tryna hit me 25 for some shit that I didn't do
Servin time is my punishment
So I'm coming with it all, tryna prove that I'm innocent
Fuck the public defender, he ain't down wit me
So I know I can't surrender
They rather try me [well ?]
Nine cases I'm facin while I sit in trial
At criminal division
Is Squeak Ru convicted? That's the decision
Then I heard him slam the gavel
Now I'm back to the holding tank, mad cuz I'm gaffled
This ain't no fairytale, you see life ain't shit in the county jail

Chorus:
Sittin in the county
Just like a party
(Westside!)
Sittin in the county
Just like a party
Sittin in the county
Just like a party
Sittin in the county, you know everybody

(Verse 2 -Squeak Ru)
Loadin up on the bus
Gots to watch my back cuz I don't wanna get rushed
I got one hand free, I'm lookin for the comrades
But all I see is enemies
It don't make sense, they got me cuffed to a muthafucker that I gang-bang against
Ey, nigga, where you from? (I don't bang, homie)
Soon as the gates wreck, you know I'm takin one
Leave ya flat on ya back, you don't wanna scrap
In fact, I'm perfect at combat
Now I'm mad as a bitch
Got a 90-500 and they gave me fish kit
And you best believe this: the brothers is strong
But the S-A's the deepest
This shit is hardco'
Crips and Bloods throwin up their set in them [???] (Inglewoooood!)
Wit the classification
OSS wanna know my gang affiliation
But that shit's expected
(Aye nigga, ain't you connected?)
You goddamn right
Cuz in the county jail
Only hards die for their stripes

Chorus

(Verse 3 -Squeak Ru)
I got a visit but it's drama
My girl in the hallway fighting with my baby momma
Now time to explain who I love the most
I gotta catch the chain
Quick to check a trustee
Cuz some of them fools be tryna playin deputy
Man, you'sa hook!
I'm rollin wit them crooks
And we don't like your flat books
I'm tired to bein a victim
It seems everytime I look I'm gettin punked by the system
It's hard bein a black man
So niggas wake up, you gotta have a backup plan
Cuz they'll stretch you out
No matter if you're coppin in the West or servin in the south
It's a livin hell
You see, life ain't shit
So fuck the county jail

[Chorus]
