[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
It's Cali Agents y'all, and we finally here
Planet Asia be switching flows just like brand new gear
Rasco got my bid-ack it's just like thit-at
It's guerrilla warfare from the chair that I sit at
Come now watch The Don spit at
The blank spaces is ours, the superstar
Tag team, you need to get at
The best has yet to come
Like double death threats or something
Spitting like The West Was One
Through the eyes, a visionary, both on the same page
Nope, can't none of y'all fuck with them cats, the Cali Agents
Detonating, and since the first time we hooked up
We cooked up a marvelous dish, so ain't no separating

[Verse 2: Rasco]
Step up in the world of the two men
Living life through the pad and a pen
Instead of locked down for seven to ten, we blend
Together, always and forever
Straight from San Fran. with that fucked up weather
It's on, they done let us out the box to rock
And you can hear that shit knock for like seventy blocks, Indeed, We be coming through with tons of speed
My man Planet As, smoke about a pound of weed, a day
We don't play we be ready to roll
Gotta chill out when life starts taking it's toll
We fold, twenties and tens
Nah, ready to win
And now cats is waiting for the melee to begin
It's on

[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
It's off the hook, huh? We took it there
I'm off crush, he off the Hen rock, plus we serve just
Now look at there, you got the mighty combo
Been in the game since the Eighties
Miraculously mashing up the art for what it made me
Document this, emcee's be having elements missing on mic's
We set it on y'all whole residence, listen (Cali Agents)
It's Cali Agent Number Two having a tantrum attack
Where Rasco just vibing on the anthem

[Verse 4: Rasco]
Most of you cats ain't used to this
Still looking for some girls to twist
Rasco bring the seriousness with this
The front man, that never had a musical band
And you can get smacked wherever you stand
We plan to do things that have never been done
Come and get some we give y'all some serious run to one
To the two, what y'all gonna do?
When we come after you leaving you black and blue
From the neck shot, now it's off to the next spot
Rasco, Plant As, double deck shot
Take the best shot, that you can take
'Cause this time's to see how much money we can make
Fo' sho' yo
