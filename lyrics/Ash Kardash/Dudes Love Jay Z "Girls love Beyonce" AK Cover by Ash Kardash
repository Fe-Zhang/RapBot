I know niggas love Jay z
Niggas be low key crazy
Say they don't love hoes
But they do, only God knows
These days I need something different in my life
These days I need somebody to get it right
I don't need no dude that's perfect
I need a dude that's worth it
Don't need a dude bout'nothing
I need a dude bout something
These days I need somebody to hold me down
He keep it real and he don't front every time he come around

[Hook:]
Like, I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So if you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So if you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

{Verse 2:]
Dont need no dude that cheating
Dont need no dude thats lame
Dont need no childish boy that's always trynna run some game
I need a dude to keep it trill and he remain the same
And he dont get behind my back and try to flip and change
Telling all his friends that he dont really be fucking with her though
And than he hang up call back hang up call back, woah
And than he hang up call back , still blowing up my phone
Leave me alone

{Hook 2:]
Cause you got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So now you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

You got 9 problems but a bitch ain't one
So now you having girl problems, I feel bad for you son
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
