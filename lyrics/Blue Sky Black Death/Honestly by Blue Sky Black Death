You were so close to the cliff
I didn't even care to notice
Rain fell over our heads
My throat trembled and said
I cover myself with your eyes
Cover myself for the first time
See to it that I will have you
Capture you when the warmth comes
Learn how your body moves
When I am next to you
You are the whiskey on my lips
Holding it when I am so far
I choose to forget your name
Far away it will all be the same
Have you break me oh in two
Every time I have to leave you
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
This will come down so hard
We will ache for a new start
In so oh absent arms
To this we'll fall apart
I will arrive on a rainy day
Show face oh at your door
You will tell me all the ways
That I will want you more
On my living room floor
So well I will explore
I will feel this even when
I cannot breathe you in
I don't remember the taxi ride
You will forget how I feel on the insides
This will mean nothing in time
In time this will mean nothing
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
In time this will mean nothing
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
In time this will mean nothing
