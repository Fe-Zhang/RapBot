[Verse 1: Beans]
Driver, human, thruster
Voice-activated secret star incognito libido
Parallel vertigo imperfection in pattern lunatic rhino on vinyl
Rocket surfer berserker, my oral ejaculations cause cerebral lacerations
And when prisms from mass projections
Won't conform or be dark
Nor attempt to disappear, no fear
Your time long past will say nothing
But my unrestricted testimony as I regard it with awe
Like facial expressions frozen in the still fixture like furniture
That's jaw modulation that aim to entertain
With new sensation rivals your illusion
The safety that wore cowboy, this is a coat as my quotes
And notice the instrument is the ?throat of the underwear? ghost
?The thinking plinko? physique is discreet as a needle
And poachers in perpetual motion to proceed over you prehistorical tribes
Did it or over the dinosaur
Extinct like an 8-track, me solo, no sidekick
Never the victim of your judgement
Zap alchemy a text ?tasigun? welcome to tomorrow
Gift wrappin' the present, I bring the past see your presence
Actions spoke volumes, turn it up and never light on the climate
The peace that rivals my thoughts in transit from your mundane entrapment
No longer in Kansas, so click your heels and make it happen

[Hook: Beans x4]
My body, your body, nobody, anybody
Not the best, but do my best
To get better, better to move the body

[Verse 2: Beans]
Backstroke to glory days, god thirsty tape recorders need water
Silhouettes and there former selves find the genuine article
Abstract but not arbitrary find my substance refreshing
Miscellaneous soap seven seas washed up
These leg on your passing
Animosity overcompensates for you lack of ideas
Therefore I leave you to yourselves
Passages dwell in the static response
With push-button affection for my phonics
And spectro-sonic catch a comet data particle accelerator
Tempo cloud spit expulsions
Like a gazelle in that gracely great leaps forward
Or microphone's like oxygen for trees to breathe
Not dissin' we're battling
But babbling beyond your mere mortal methodology
In the blink of an ear
Limited by the fatigue and the lack of your capacity
Manage the bliss of ignorance of our audacity
Vital upheaval administered similar to vaccine
Gift of tongue legible incredible
Decibel thrust to the bowl gets sparked
Epic for a wide world waiting
The sins of saccharine sentences
Moral corrupt into seven heads from my severe tongue lashing
No longer in Kansas, so click your heels and make it happen
