[Cuts]
Yes, yes y’all and you don’t stop
Yes, yes y’all and you don’t stop
Yes, yes y’all and you don’t stop
Keep it on and shockin’ the place
Yes, yes y’all and you don’t stop
Yes, yes y’all and you don’t stop
Yes, yes y’all and you don’t stop
Keep it on and shockin’ the place

[Verse 1]
You all seeing, the God believing human being
I walks the streets recollecting nigga’s feelings
From my mind, my pulse free fluctuates strong
Increasing pressure on my chest I’m never wrong
And with the phone call precise to ring the low
Which you steal so we can practice on theatrics
In fact is time to light combine with the borough
I flash in the hurry, that makes my eyes blurry still scurry
Tomorrow gots to go even doe on the down low
Don’t know if I have enough to go
Time’s wastin’, buzz comes in small inhalation
Get on the gravity and lie about my destination
G-Knight sounds pro, all is down your eyes when I gets down to the nitty
This thing's moving damn slow
Chill for an hour then reach the mall and still walk through the corridors with my eyes on my bills
I still pass crews not amuse me not indistinguish the English when they freestyle and jack
Try to pass by and send me damn cold
You try to find my soul save your rhymes for the mind
Nigga, I break it down for your headpiece and give peace sense and write the jeopardies

[Hook]
Carry on
Never do crime to all mankind
Make a line, feel the pain, I’m running out of time
No lies will get done, I never had a gun
I’m leaving you with trauma when G-Knight bring the drama
Carry on
Never do crime to all mankind
Make a line, feel the pain, I’m running out of time
No lies will get done, I never had a gun
I’m leaving you with trauma when G-Knight bring the drama

[Verse 2]
With these words I carry on with slurs with the herbs
That are getting slapped up with the verbs violated but still calm
When I drop bombs all the times G-Knight make your infection feel warmer
And competition nickels my verses
They scared to the hip I flip like acrobats on heroine
Kind of a backward thing when I rhyme
Because I’ll shake your hand and stab your back at the same time
I sleaze when I displays like fester but you can’t tell I’m portable while you get bleached
Who style is fatter this year? Plus rapper Elemental capping styles like the Mad Hatter
Would for real ended up confused or defeated
Bionic, mathematic, organic or human bank teller
G-Knight you rep for [?] MCs who can’t flex
With skills swing snap your cypher
It’s time to release your left rhymes
Heard the few spectators foul
I’ll leave your cranium convertible
Suburb child with my connections in the borough
When times gets rough I get disguised by my verbal

[Hook]
Carry on
Never do crime to all mankind
Make a line, feel the pain, I’m running out of time
No lies will get done, I never had a gun
I’m leaving you with trauma when G-Knight bring the drama
Carry on
Never do crime to all mankind
Make a line, feel the pain, I’m running out of time
No lies will get done, I never had a gun
I’m leaving you with trauma when G-Knight bring the drama

[Outro]

All I have is God, my God…
And I thought
All I have is God
I’m gone
