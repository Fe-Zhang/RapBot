[Intro]
God Forbid I should
What?
Nigga you wanna?
I doubt that very highly

[Verse 1]
Yo
I counterbalance the serenity
With signs of battle inclination
Mind obliteration destruction
A mild disfiguration
Consumption of the middle creation that’s MC
Middle class no affiliation, abomination
Pitiful Massignon[?] invigorating asinine
Organization turning niggas into bitches ovulating
Rhythm of blues and soul rotation, aggravating
You see me first be my written[?]
Meaning disperse to hear a blur on the horizon fading
I’m size amazing
Cause if I’d known a rival was a mastermind in Ottawa
For here and after
Overseer of the Roland Sphere
This here like NASA
Witness superior career potential
Crush the merely mortal mental master of the universe
See me on a twist like Rasta
We’re speaking through more verse
Divine central shadow caster
Who next to common class generic niggas complaining my glasses on the common now[?]

[Hook]
God forbid
I should ever lose my grip on this
My trade – my duty – my drug – my love – my shit
My what?
Black dove, black dove
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can’t take the jungle out the cat
What’s that?
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can’t take the jungle out the cat
Nah, God forbid
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can’t take the jungle out the cat

[Verse 2: Schizm]
Yo
You try to mimic
You’ve reached your limit
You can’t copy no gimmick
Ordeals imitated never duplicated
Davidic prophecy stated there’d be critics
Posies’ and native bitches on the didic[?]
Here comes a savior diamond in the ruff
For sheep and wolves who come to give in
Out of the mists of schism
Hit it on the head like a nail while others miss it
Failin' in the frigid waters
I’m from the mystic fathers of the universe
I’m four corners of the galaxy
Send a message of Jula herbs
Accentuate your fallacies
Your destiny and fate and actualities subject you to
Your own medicine and mentality direct from you
Sheeps come correctly, not from cowardly I expect from you
Apologies to the avid as you
Swallow the tablet trying to kill you from your averageness
You never heard a dove reflect and turn to savageness
That’s why I break it down to gerbers for your babble bitch

[Hook]
God forbid
I should ever lose my grip on this
My trade – my duty – my drug – my love – my shit
My what?
Black dove, black dove
God forbid
I should ever lose my grip on this
My trade – my duty – my drug – my love – my shit
My shit
Black dove, black dove
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can’t take the jungle out the cat
What’s that?
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can’t take the jungle out the cat
Bitch, God forbid
Take a nigga out the jungle
Forbid, forbid, forbid, God forbid
But you can’t take the jungle out the cat
