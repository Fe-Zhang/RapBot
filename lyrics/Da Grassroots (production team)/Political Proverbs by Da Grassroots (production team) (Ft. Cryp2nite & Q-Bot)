[Verse 1: Cryp2nite]
When I'm chilling all alone I take a moment to reflect
All the trials and tribulations, the living in the projects
Being exposed to men those who hustle to double profit
It's only logic, it's easy money is the object
Everybody wanna stop it y'all, cops get caught
Come rushing to the spot, some cats lost it all
I guess that they'll come when that master plan fails
When the rich become poor and that poor shall prevail
Son it's written in the Ancient Books of Criminology
That time'll come for all and get a taste the prophecies
So save your animosity, this is how it's meant to be
Preserve your energy, relax and blaze the century
You can't change a thing son and if I were you I wouldn't try
It's the ways of the streets and that's your troubles multiply
You can run but can't hide from this killer in disguise
It's the evil that'll capsize your whole enterprise
But life's a bitch and then you die
And in this money-hungry world son there ain't no limit but the sky

[Hook: Cryp2nite & Q-Bot + sample]
To all them so-called grades I'ma
Let you know when I'm coming from, yeah
When the profits are staid I'ma
Let you know when I'm coming from, yeah
The dynasty don't fake so I'ma
Let you know when I'm coming from, yeah
And anytime I touch this track I'ma
Let you know when I'm coming from, yeah

[Verse 2: Q-Bot]
The system wanna lock us down, ain't no way, no how
Got us strapped up to arms 'cause the war starts now
Every day getting closer to the end
I'm feeling like I can't comprehend
'Cause marijuana has to smoke  and money must end
The faster, the better way, however we gotta be more probably
Near by I feel somebody watching me
Cops want to shut off all the tax free activity
Shipping, smuggling and airplane drug delivery
We all wanna make it fat and live life large
They told me trafficking narcotics is the federal charge
What would he tell if false alarm [?]
[?]

[Verse 3: Cryp2nite]
It's been so many different times when I never thought I'd make it
Chilling, dine a murder cap, put my head up but I faked it
Y'all never could've guessed all the stress that I was feeling
Suppressed, thought it was resting on my chest
And God blessed the young ghetto youth with a gift
A 20/20 vision so I can see what I was truly dealing with
As the clock ticking the time moved on
Watch them niggas on the block juggling rocks from dusk 'til dawn
But what you're gonna do when all the hard and cash is gone?
Sitting home all alone singing the same all song?
And y'all pockets are broke and all the Aliz√© is gone?
Life ain't treating you right but you got it all wrong
Life is what you make it bro, that's the sure in the long
At last, forget your past 'cause it's time to move on
There's a future out there and I swear one day I'll get mines
Or die trying 'cause my balls are made of solid iron
Got dreams of going platinum so I can buy an island
Smoke trees as I please and live my life self-aligning

And anytime I touch this track I'ma
