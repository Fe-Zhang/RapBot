[Chorus: ZillaKami]
One for the gang, two for the fame
Three for the name, four to the grave
Put the nail in the coffin, lay him down for a minute (What's up, what's up?)
Put the nail in the coffin, lay him down for a minute (What's up, what's up?)

[Verse 1: SosMula]
I turn the soft into bricks of the crack
Then we gon' toss all the bricks in the back
Then we gon' sell all the bricks on the ave
Bitch, I'm a Blood, ain't no Crip on my rag
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'ma catch a whole state with the case
Wait, wait, wait, wait
I'ma pull up, blow your brains on the dash
Fifty clip shoot the opps
Bendin' the corners, we shoot the block (Blaow)
Fuck it, we gon' shoot at the **** (Rrah)
I'ma just shoot 'til you drop (Rrah)
I'ma just spit in your face
You gon' get hit with the gauge (Yeah)
Take the pin out the grenade, nigga
And we'll go piss in your grave

[Verse 2: ZillaKami]
Okay, I'm tired of y'all niggas actin' crazy and shit (Okay)
When the dogs come out, we ain't playin' that shit (What's up?)
My niggas ain't scared, beware, don't dare
Beware I ain't scared, beware don't dare, beware

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
One for the gang, two for the fame
Three for the name, four to the grave
Put the nail in the coffin, lay him down for a minute (What's up, what's up?)
Put the nail in the coffin, lay him down for a minute (What's up, what's up?)
One for the gang, two for the fame
Three for the name, four to the grave
Put the nail in the coffin, lay him down for a minute (What's up, what's up?)
Put the nail in the coffin, lay him down for a minute (What's up, what's up?)
