[Verse 1: ZillaKami]
Woke up drenched in a sweat so cold
That it froze my home, wanna go to Hell
'Cause at least it's warm on a brimstone floor
No love no more, I'm gettin' frail (Yeah)
And my face is not the same as before
I cannot see who I was before
I died and was reborn as a dog
I cannot look myself in the mirror
I cause quakes
Last to touch everything that breaks (Okay)
And I'd rather not even show my face
Cops on the block and they buildin' a case (Wassup?)
Hope that these shots put holes in ya cape
I don't want nobody savin' the day
This black AK got somethin' to say (Okay)
It's okay, just back up and pray (What?)

[Chorus: ZillaKami & SosMula]
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate (Mula)

[Verse 2: SosMula]
Ayy, my shotty got a body on it (Sleezy)
Tommy got a body on it (Sleezy)
I just body my opponents (Boom-boom)
I'm John Gotti, you's a rodent (Fuck outta here)
Double barrel shotgun, run like Ricky (Rrah)
Hit 'em with a hot one, drum hold fifty (Boom-boom)
Cop killer shells like Mutombo's pinky (Boom-boom)
Bitch curl up like a jumbo shrimpy (Slide)
Feds wanna watch everything I do (No, no)
CNN, Fox 5, 10 o'clock news (Bitch)
Mom's stressed, kids stressed, and pops too (Boom-boom)
My wrist, carats, your gang buy jewel (Mula)
Shawty suck my soul 'til my dick turn blue (Slide)
Shawty fuck me crazy like a sick cartoon (Slide)
In a Mercedes, I go vroom-vroom (Skrrt)
Niggas talkin' brazy, they get boom-boom (Boom-boom)

[Chorus: ZillaKami & Denzel Curry]
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate (Ugh-ah)

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
I might have it all
But half of the time I just feel insignificant
Incapable, intoxicated
I'm over the pressure, yet feel underprivileged
Like my kingdom is buried in sand
Ozymandias, I am the man
As I look at the cards in my hand
The fortune teller of the tarots says terror
I'm sick of artists that chuck up the deuce
When they get the juice when you helped from the roots
And I'm sick of hoes that walk in and seduce
But then talkin' shit once you give 'em the boot, ahem
Clear your throat 'cause you know you a swallower
Up to me? I would kill the whole lot of ya
So it's part two to Hell or High Water, huh?
Test your gangsta but went Law & Order, huh?

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
Can't catch tears when they're all down the drain
Can't cry now, but can self-medicate
