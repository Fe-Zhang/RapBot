[Intro: ZillaKami]
Yeah!

[Pre-Chorus: ZillaKami]
Godzilla with the microwave, cause a heatwave
Ziggler with the suplex slam, make the ground shake
Y'all do too much, feeling pain, you move too much
Proceed like sorry, not sorry

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
Chop 'em down wardog, let 'em all off
All out war 'til you get it called off
Chop 'em down wardog, let 'em all off
All out war 'til you get it called off

[Verse 1: SosMula]
Look, I'm like Bob the Builder, bitch, with the big tool (T-t-t-trra)
30 hanging out, like niggas used to skip school (Trra)
R.I.P. Woozy, I'm the nigga you can live through (R.I.P.)
Yeah, the big blood with his motherfuckin' wrist blue
Tell papi through the mail, he could send the bricks through
Got a addy for the touchdown when they get through (What)
Pussy boy, kill that noise, I'm that boy, get who?
Listen, you a bitch, lil' nigga, I'm a pit bull
Drop a location, pull up on him, check his temperature
'Cause when we bump heads, make sure you got that energy (Grra)
I'ma leave them punks dead, pourin' out that Hennessy
Niggas in the trunk dead, niggas can't remember me

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
Chop 'em down wardog, let 'em all off
All out war 'til you get it called off
Chop 'em down wardog, let 'em all off
All out war 'til you get it called off

[Bridge: ZillaKami]
Let's fade away
Into the rain
Don't entertain
What they cannot relate

[Verse 2: ZillaKami]
Little black glass, addicted to sellin' dime sacks (Okay)
Pedal down fast, I'm speedin', can't take my time back (What's up)
If you ride with 'em then go ahead and die with 'em
You was happy 'til you against me (Yeah)
Came to the conclusion that you hidin' from shit
Because ya' mans' mysteriously be dyin' and shit
And that revenge, y'all niggas ain't never take none
Dead friends, that's why I never make none (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: ZillaKami]
Godzilla with the microwave, cause a heatwave
Ziggler with the suplex slam, make the ground shake
Y'all do too much, feeling pain, you move too much
Proceed like sorry, not sorry

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
Chop 'em down wardog, let 'em all off
All out war 'til you get it called off
Chop 'em down wardog, let 'em all off
All out war 'til you get it called off
