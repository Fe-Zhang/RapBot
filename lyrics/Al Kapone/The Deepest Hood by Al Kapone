Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deepest hood
Is time to pone out the piece
Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deepest hood

South side if your deep, let me see you get'um up
North side if your deep, let me see you put'um up
East side if your deep, let me see you get'um up
West side if your deep, let me see you put'um up

Chorus:
My hood (my hood) we deep (we deep)
My hood (my hood) we deep (we deep)
We'll cooka (cooka) if we got feet (got feet)
We'll cooka (cooka) if we got feet (got feet)

South side if your deep, let me see you get'um up
North side if your deep, let me see you put'um up
East side if your deep, let me see you get'um up
West side if your deep, let me see you put'um up

I'm ridin with my hitta's, I'm ridin wit my hood
It don't matter if they rida up to no good
We stick together like the matrix, you stepped away
You stepped to our indefa bar trick

We don't cook, whatcha playin, whatcha represent
Who you win, who you know, trick down is relavent
You disrespect our hood, we break it to your wiv

You can leave that body, cast or body bag
Yeh walk on her, that's my dog, say it good
You with us, sh*t lets go, and girl lets get that understood
Lets get that understood, trick you ain't down wit me

See we donno you, where you just might be da enemey

[Repeat Chorus]

Dis ain't a fu*king game, it's ridin down wit us
You reckless eyeballin, that's violation bra, no hesitation bra
We swarmin like no other bee

Wit zero understanding me yo after oh to the be
We shot the up down, mup, security
That light gonna turn into a war zone, we soverty

You bringin that pig, we normally cook, that sh*t like medium rare
You innocent bystand, better getch yo, away from there
We felt this way, when we ate it, bullets never had no name

Do something the way we could, death is now you have the game
Yo mama warrened you, the streets anit all good, trick
You never know, you maybe good, you mess the hood

You never know you might think you messed the hood
(You never know you might think you messed the hood)
Yo mama warrened you, the streets anit all good, trick
Is save da game, and you can put that on the hood

[Repeat Chorus]

Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deep (who got the deep)
Who got the deepest hood

Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deepest hood
Who got the deep (who got the deep)
Who got the deepest hood

Yeh, it's time to pone out the peicey, oh more
It's time to pone out the peicey, oh more
