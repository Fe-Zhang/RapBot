[Verse 1: Oddisee]
Yeah I came here on a ship but I flew out on a plane
Trade these shackles and a whip for some status and a name
And the hassle's still the same, and my ticket's still in coach
And my seat is near the toilet, guess this shit won't ever change
What's a black suppose to do, sell some crack and entertain?
Get a bachelor in some bullshit and a job below my aim?
I was shooting for the star, they're shootin' rockets at the moon
Reach in my pockets for my keys, the cop is reachin' for the tools
If you can see me on the news, I hope that's cuz I'm on a roll
Tryna keep me on a leash but I ain't out here on parole
Yeah I'm free to go, freedom reign, free them chains, freedom fries
Free to try, only thing promised to me is a free demise
This is why my hustle strong, I grew up watching Huxtables
My mamma grew up watching kids, her mamma grew up washing clothes
Overcomin' obstacles, way before doctor Martin spoke
Barack can't give me hope, mamma gave me that 'fore her aqua broke. Yea

[Hook: Oddisee]
I'm not a lost cause, I am a far cry
But I can still call and get involved, I
Ain't out here with no sign, I'm looking for one in the streets
Now marching to that drum but we still ridin' to that beat
Yeah we still riding to that beat
Your feeling's in my soul
And I can only struggle like my kinfolk did before
Stride it, ride, and oh yeah we on a roll
Ain't nuttin gonna stop me, I ain't out, I'm in control
Oh yeah, let's go

[Verse 2: XO]
My brother saw enough blood, no decision I don't
Three Gs in my closet, that's what made me cold
My daddy gone by 12, started stealing my clothes
I was put behind that cell and next thing you know
My grandma had my bail
She said “Son, better's you go”
I said ”I ain't going no way grandma, I ain't have no dope”
I shoulda called you so, my problem's wrong for sure
And something in my soul said we gotta go
When I went like, we got to, we got, we got to go
The motherfucker we got the dope
Better be out, come on
We got to roll, we bout to blow
'mon brother, we Al Capone
We got to, we got to, we got to go
Yall wanna be there, come on
Yall wanna be there, we'll be there
We should hope we never ever
End the day till the mothafuckin eon
We don't want these people to roll
Then some are D I suppose
Yall n*ggas be out the polls
Before the revolution got to beat out, seed out, weed out the ho's
Pull it stick it in three of them holes
Through DC I propose
Then I get you with phonetic
Come and take your head, leave out the toes
Wouldn't leave me out the cause, this my cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3: yU]
This is a call to them folks who got hopes high
They heard a lot of things, believe when seen with my own eyes
Hell yeah got drive and that's the reason I drove wild
But no one's living slow so I switch the pace up one more time
Now I’m tryin to get it to the point where my kids’ kids can live it up
So I'm taking it's overrated, if you wanna change you gotta give it up
And yeah you love to hear the story, feel it's raw for your drums
Beat through each lung, old and young and now we overcome
Each one, teach one (I'm about that)
Buildin' them bridges (I'm about that)
Expanding our vision (I'm about that)
Switch up your decisions if you want an outcome that's different (I'm about that)
Head up, fed up, scared enough and isn't, best believe (I'm about that)
Passing on tradition and reaching soul for the seeds (I'm about that)
All out, long ride, the very last one to roll out
That's sauerkraut, pouting over losses, just the wrong route
Me kicking that rhyme and just like that picket sign
From '79 until the now, the clock ticking it's time, for Y

[Hook]
