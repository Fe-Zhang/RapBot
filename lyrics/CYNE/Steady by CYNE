[Verse 1: Cise Star]
Yo packing the package is the world water coming disastrous
I'm getting bottles of water and matches cause it's hazardous
Immaculate hate
And Montagues versus the Capulets
Ruining generations and nations are going at it
I'm on the frontlines of these perilous times
Confusion blinds the minds of world leaders we need a sign
A ray of hope through this dark cloud of injustice
Motherfuck this city of gold that the foreman has lusted
Jewel encrusted greed feeds apocalypse
Can't you see the blips on the radar
Missile hits
Overconfident
War strategists became the catalysts
Angry capitalists
The stock market's spastic

[Hook]
Gotta get it ready my body and soul steady
Heart heavy from living so long in these last days
Crusades of itself
Got us selling ourselves short
Gotta abort lifestyles and into something more

[Verse 2: Akin]
We let the mic breathe life to dying breeds
In need we feed words that breed hope
Maneuver past the greed indeed
We made the eagle fly
We made freedom cry by watching them try deceiving the eye
Fucking alibi
We was there
On the balcony
The shots blare
My vision was scarred but we're still here
Something for the people y'all
Do you remember when Martin had a dream and Bobby had a regimen
They severed and the struggle's on
My thoughts are settling
I gotta play the part and no other role I'm better in
Words embedded in revolutionary medicine
I took one pill and the shit was on ever since
I'm trying to keep an open mind in the wilderness
I hold a sign 'Wisdom is War', and it's opened my
Heart and mind to who we are
So where's the price list
The fight opposite the whirlwind till your lifeless
Look, the game plan's to defeat the man
Fuck trying to beat the man
I navigate seas into freedom land
Get at the people if you're trying to soothe the pain
But if not, move over cause I'm trying to see change (for real)

[Verse 3: Cise Star]

It's the raven that never came
Back to the ark hanging out with the viper at the garden of eden that angered the God
Show who you really are
Moon eclipsing the star
But Cise one reborn scorned by human flaws
So who is this saying that money is bliss?
Your logic remiss
You and the devil about to kiss
I dismiss motherfuckers leading our brothers through streets and gutters
Overflowing for tears for my mother's that bawl
As they witness the death of their children
While they're alive and realize they
Fell victim to American nightmare
Daring to dream things ain't never what they seem, can we ever redeem?
Hold on to old principles and still remain sensible
Analog heart became digital
