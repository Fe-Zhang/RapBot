"Yo, God, you eva wonder what the fuck your purpose is out here man
What you put on this earth for?"
"Her﻿e we go again"
"Nah, for real man"

[Verse 1]
I was a child of the 80s
Growin up in the 90s
A small black child of power, you couldn't find me
Because I shyly, would hide away from the faces
They used to look me in the face, baby you'll make it
And told me to stand strong
Because you're gonna be gone beyond the dark, the sun shine hard
A new day so I pray I'm gonna make 'em right
I fight for life and make sure my life's right
I stand strong on my own two
So what you gonna do? I hold you
In the web of my speech and mold you
Into my past﻿ cuz this verse is a looking glass
Silk past the evil, here to serve my people
Forever

[Hook]
To this night a child is born
A lone star coming out of the sky to lead the wise men
Come again? Tell me the truth, I wanna listen
A heavy burden I carry for my people to live

[Verse 2]
Losin my mind one piece at a time
Rewind﻿ events in my life and I find
The hardships outnumber the good times
Still I stand tall and hold my head high
Flee the scenes; maybe things get better
But know they never did it I'm back to where I started
Smoking packs a day and acting like alcoholics
No money in my wallet and feelin really retarded
Fuck the bullshit so I hit the school shit
Got the degree and made these other motherfuckers see I am who I am
I stand tall like God, worked hard
[Erected to some?], my name is Cise Starr
You wanna talk about, then you wanna be me now?
Fell outta the sky and rose outta the ground?
A new man, new plan so Goddamn
I got fans, they float to Ja-pan

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Momma died so I had to get my own work done
I couldn't sit around and be a bitch and not do shit
Worked hard for everything that you see that I got you
Motherfuckers gettin mad but you walking the block
When I'll be up in my shop, writing my rhymes
Got a call from Akin and we formed the group CYNE (hello)
Now look at this now, a short time later
We devastating the area showing the local haters we are
Not just a transitory pause, 2 niggas right here for the cause
Cise Starr survived divine universal bitch!
I'll hurt you if you ever call us commercial

Educated gifted minds shine throughout the ignorance
We thirsty
