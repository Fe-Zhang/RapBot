Illuminati satellites watch where you walk
Tasing us in public, got you scared to talk
All your mans are bought, your judges are conmen
Justice is gone when you locked in a box
It feels like a coffin, they watch where you walking
They watching New York, Baltimore and Boston
Watching California, they watch all ya
Thought you got away but then the forensic caught ya
Where the human eye wouldn't never saw ya
They inspect half follicles and dead the best lawyer
Got your mind locked with eyes in that box
Desensitize all plots, cops fired shots
Revolutionize, they watch we watch back
They buck shots, real gangsters buck shots back
And you running from court, locked up north
Need to watch where you walk, they watch where you walk

[Hook #1 - Tones]
They watch you, got they eye on your currency
Fuck Illuminati, they try to murder me
You hear their lies but I speak the truth
So even when I die the words reach the youth
[2x]

[Tones]

They got an eye on your dollar, it's the debt that you borrow
Tryna make you believe that you'll be rich tomorrow
It's a set up, we first pay with hospital bills
Born into nothing, this fucking poverty kills
They shot him at will, claim he thought he had a gun
They thought he looked suspicious, next time my man should run
The camera zones in on your face in HD
Play it live on satellite, courtesy of VOD
FBI headquarters with my MP3
Put me on the red list, gas chamber ID
With they plastic coffins outside major cities
Shipped off to spots, are you playing with me?
When I seen the footage, I can see the bullets
Seen the train lines mainlining you their bullshit
That's why each hooded full moon, holding up a shotty
With delusions of grandeur, fuck the soul of Illuminati

[Hook #1 - Tones]

[Coal Cash]

Yeah resource exhausted, they feast from your corpses
Off a corp with killing spree, tryna feed til they nauseous
Caustic facility, villainy in a fortress
With thoughts of enslaving us, fuck your Habeas corpus
Of course there's session lines tapping all of your phones
They're known to misinform the masses with bastards like Alex Jones
Got your home under surveillance, assailants unveiling privacy
A visory to the site, showing your life for all eyes to see
Surprisingly your sight don't see Skype as home invasion
Amazing your persuasion of life, despite the nation
Replacing liberty with chimneys of the anus
I'm nameless but still they watch, I don't gots to be famous
For the 90's paparazzi, they got me on ?? war
Hazardous spread the lag, I wave more red flags than matadors
And data stores in us sent from FBI DICA's
Safe to say they watch me and they probably just a block away
The block the way of 13K, you can't ignore it
Cuz we saw the war at home, we came to slay the Gnomes of ZÃ¼rich
And Europe is the center of the Bilderberg agenda
While they gentrify from all seeing eyes, better remember

[Hook #2 - Coal]
They watch you through sites on the internet
Fuck Illuminati, we always been a threat
Believe the lies that they told to the youth
And don't open your fucking eyes when we show you the proof
[2x]

[Coal Cash]

Son I'm hot headed, I burn the wreath of Athena
The system fucked you in the ass fast as Abd al-Mu'min
You do not get it, they're tryna dead it with FEMA
Just to deem public demeanor that they seen at Katrina
You did not set it, so they bet it was easy
You can occupy the block, most'll watch it from TV
They got PD on lock, fuck cops they shot people
While sheeple sit and watch and adopt it's not evil
It's not equal, no right for parasites
You will write for the data they gather on satellites
I'm out of sight, still they got me on Google
The approval of illusion, try using your noodle
No elude in the pupil, or they watch for ?? Horus
They watch you when you're home on camera phones where they saw us
You heard the chorus, then ignore us on track
And it's all due to the fact that you're scared to react

[Hook #3 - Coal]
They watch you through CISPA
Fuck Illuminati, red flags a mark away
Say what you want but they're watching you now
Said you want a revolution but don't even know how
[2x]

Yeah I talk shit at the end of the track. You're all slaves. Y'all can't even get up and do shit. They're watching you, wake the fuck up assholes. Revolution's here
