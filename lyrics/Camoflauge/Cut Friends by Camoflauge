[Verse 1]
Say there, lil' mama what's yo' name and shhh...

You gots a paper and a pen
Hit a playa up, I come through on ya and slide in
Oh, ya got a man
Well that's cool, I ain't tryna be that
Cut friends, you never been with me and you could be that
I ain't kissin' and tellin' like Kelly
Baby we can keep it on the down low
You down with what I'm down for
Late night creepin', yo' man won't even suspect you cheatin'
And if I see you in the streets I ain't lookin' or speakin'
But when we meetin' we freakin' and thats fo' sho'
Oh, and we can keep it on the low
Ain't nobody gots to know
Tell ya daddy that 'cha goin' out wit'cha homegirl
Cuz tonight me and you gone get up in our own world
Get a suite, blow on a sweet, tear up the sheets
And if ya wanna, we can do this here again next week

And we can roll out, get Dro'ed out, get a pode out
Two old fold real don't nobody gotta know about
Park yo' Honda on my parkin' lot in front of the sto'
Jump in with me, hit the highway, to the room we go
Oh, no, I need to get a box of (rubbers)
So I can, get that (throat), then jump in the covers
Shower up and drop you off, so you can get with your lover
Call me up later baby girl, when you ready to cut again
Hit the (weed), smash off in the whip
Hey, lil' mama let's play

[Hook] 4x

[Verse 3]
Baby girl can we kick it, I'm sorry if I'm too explicit
It's just that you without no clothes on got me dizzy
I like yo' size, the look in yo' eyes
That thing between yo' thighs, can I push inside?
Do you wanna roll wit me, hit out the Mo' wit me
Freak, from the bed to the flo' wit me, but no hickeys
Forget ya man, you with a player tonight
We can pop a couple of bottles, just to make it right
And after that, I'mma try an break your back, get'cha from the back
Make you feel it in ya stomach, ask you 'How ya luv that'
Me and you ducked off, gettin' our (nuts) off
Cut off ya cellular phone, girl let's get lost
