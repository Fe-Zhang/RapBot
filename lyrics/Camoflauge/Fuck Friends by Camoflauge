Jump in wit me hit the highway to the room we go

Shower up and drop you off so you can get wit yo lover
Call me up later baby girl when your ready to fuck a-gain
Hit the weed smash off in the wind

Baby girl can we kick it, I'm sorry if I'm too explicit
Visions of you with out no clothes on got me dizzy

That thing between yo thighs, can I push inside?
Do you wanna roll wit me, hit a optimo wit me
Freak from the bed to the floor wit me
But no hickies, fuck yo man you wit a player tonight
We gon pop a couple of bottles just to make shit right
And after that I'ma try to break ya back, hit ya from the back
Make you feel it in your stomach ask you how you love that

Cut off your cellular phone girl lets get lost
