[VERSE 1]
Dubs of my slug spit another hit got me on a road trip
A habit I won't kick I don't care if I'm sick as long as the
Needle sticks I hear the music I need another fix I like
The mix in the street watch me geek can't stop won't
Sleep its in my blood deep I feel heat when I speak to
Explain the unique rush I get from every sheet bout to
Eat can't live without it it makes me weak on and off
Beat it's such a treat stimulated all week fiends seek
My formula blood shot around the corneas I'm warning
Yea a high heart rate when I demonstrate my product on
The plate getting cut up then rotate then mind state
Hallucinate when they imitate to be Distrakt the
Great overdose intake eliminates the fake this
Game got me straight getting so much cake I'm
Addicted no escape I tell them to take a trip cop
A dub don't bug this is your brain on drugs

[Chorus]
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Pick it up for a dime pick it up any time
This is your brain on drugs
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Guaranteed to blow your mind
This is your brain on drugs
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Pick it up any time
This is your brain on drugs
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Pick it up for a dime
This is your brain on drugs

[VERSE 2]
Find it in the club find it on the block find it at your local corner
Drug package and stock it puts a bop in my walk slang in my talk
Chased by the cops when they see me slanging the rock girls on
The jock cause it makes them feel sticky and hot a junky around
The clock avoiding detox lock in a boom box many scripts I jot
Blowing up the spot like a raid steady getting paid wrap in
Cellophane after its made high grade potent have you choking
Full scale broken no joking I'm smoking its got me open like a
Fresh sack biters have a snack ask for Distrakt techniques got my
Tracks up and down the arm have you coming back I won't take a
Break when I feel it I shake then create traffic it from state to state
Leaving crowds half baked in enormous rates I tell them to take a
Trip cop a dub don't bug this is your brain on drugs

[Chorus]
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Pick it up for a dime pick it up any time
This is your brain on drugs
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Guaranteed to blow your mind
This is your brain on drugs
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Pick it up any time
This is your brain on drugs
I got Dope beats dope rhymes dope line for line
Pick it up for a dime
This is your brain on drugs
