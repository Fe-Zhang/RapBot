Sensuality of the Imortality
In the dimension of laments
With the extreme anxieties of a third eye
Showing a lost paradise...

We lie in the cosmic tomb
Awating the day of liberation

Searching the unreal past
When the breeze echoes in my face
I'll enter in my mind
As I'll gather illusions
Not loosing the purest hate
But the shining hope
...the shining hope...

Triangular atmosphere
Structured by my fears
The icosahedron day of phases
Formulate the reborn of my exitence

(as) I see the sun
With the cover frost
The cosmos within

This is the open road
With pain and mourn
The eternal pale moonlight
Touch my morbid curiosity

I'm the cosmos as I'm my self
Surrounded by the hypocrisy
And I've tasted the bitter dust
And my heart lies therein...
