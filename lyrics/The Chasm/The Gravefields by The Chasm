True and frozen, my madness, where do i go?
I feel so cold inside...

The land and sky embrace My voice
Which sometimes is my only companion
In the distance where the moonlight cries
I see my time, so short And so strange

I left behind My illusions
Only the music In my hands warms me
I left behind my illusions
In a dark mountain of eternity

These must be my lost kingdom
I taste The mourning in the haze
My lips feel the bitterness In this rivers
And my salty eyes Answer to the blood-red sky

One thousand nights are my Days
The spiritual Casket is whispering my name
And sadness turns to sadness
My hate is my will
And love is my fear...

Long time ago, My dreams They were gone
I was as I wonder why the gates are Closed to me?
