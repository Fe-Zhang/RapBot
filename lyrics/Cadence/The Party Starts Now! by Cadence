Get up, party penguins
Come on, haven't you heard?
I get a lot of distance
For a little flightless bird
I'm a crown queen of this funky scene
With my stylin' diva puffle
And my ice cold beats
Can I get a what what?
Can I get a who? where?
At the coolest club around

The party starts NOW
When I waddle in
Turn the music loud for an epic win
DJ K Dance in the house!
Get ready to move
You can boogie down
Cause I'm spinning tunes
The party starts NOW ah ah ah ow!
The party starts NOW ah ah ah ow!
Let's begin the count down!
Let's turn it up loud!
Come on, 5-4-3-2-1
The party starts now!

Come on, get your flippers up
High in the sky
And if you wave em hard enough
Then you might even fly
If you can't can't
You can break dance
'Til you're chillin' like a villain
In sub-zero arctic wind
If they say "Don't dance"
You say "no chance"
Yeah, we bring the LOLs

The party starts NOW
When I waddle in
Turn the music loud for an epic win

The party starts NOW ah ah ah ow!
Let's begin the count down!
Let's turn it up loud!
Come on, 5-4-3-2-1
The party starts now!

Aaaaw yeah!
I got my boom box with me and I'm ready to spin
Turn tables into microphones
In case you're wonderin'
When the party starts and you're still asking around
It doesn't start in 5 minutes!
The party starts now!

The party starts NOW
