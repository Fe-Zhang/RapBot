Ohhhh, ohhhhh

[Chorus]
Why do you think that?
Why would you say that?
Why you always do that?
I'm asking cuz I don't know where you came from
Don't know what you're made of
Don't know what you've been through, what you afraid of

[Verse 1]
So your daddy was addicted to the bottle
Your momma didn't speak up
Living in the middle of a war zone
Tryna keep your head up
Over water

[Bridge]
So you learned to keep your mouth shut
You learned to never say nothing
Thats why you never say nothing
I'm begging you to say something
I'm just tryna pray for ya
I'm tryna make a way for ya
Tryna get to know you
Like really get to know you
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh

[Chorus]
Like why do you think that?
Why would you say that?
Why you always do that?
I'm asking cuz I don't know where you came from
Don't know what you're made of
Cuz I don't know what you've been through, what you afraid of
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh

[Verse 2]
So you've never slept through a whole night
Praying to God its gonna be alright
Tryna sing a good song
One that only you know
Like la la la la la
La la la la la
No words cuz you gotta keep your mouth shut
You better keep it secret
Nobody else could know this
Nobody else could see this
Don't tell nobody else
Don't love nobody else
Thats why you're by yourself, ohhh

[Bridge]
You learned to never say nothing
That's why you never say nothing
I'm begging you to say something
I'm just tryna pray for ya
I'm tryna make a way for ya
Tryna get to know you
Like really get to know you
Ohhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhhhh
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh

[Verse 3]
So we back to that
Thought we handled that
Why you gotta hang up?
Now I'm calling you back
So you wanna shut down
That's how you gonna act, ohhhh
I need you to break it down
I don't wanna break you down
But my heart is vacant now
My heart is breaking now

[Chorus/Outro]
Cuz I don't know what you've been through, what you're afraid of
And I don't know what they did to you
Or how you came up
And do I really know the real you?
Or is it made up?
Do I really know the real you?
Or is it made up?

[Outro]
I need you to break it down
I don't wanna break you down
I need you to break it down
I don't wanna break you down
