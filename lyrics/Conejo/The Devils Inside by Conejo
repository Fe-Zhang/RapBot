[Verse 1]
I made the news, I was on Fox 11
Saying I was on the run for a One Eight Seven
U.S Marshalls, they deployed on me
They just got a lead, I'm in the N.Y.C
And﻿ down inside with the terror cell
A.T.F. move in on the gates of hell
This two swat fail, trying to get me tail
Ese shit got hot so I had to bail
And I just got back from the ATL
Won't mention no names but I'm supplying them well
Wrapped up, so them dogs don't smell 'em
I'm a leave it up to you, I'm a convicted felon
But they﻿ say I'm like the C.I.A
For bringing work to the ghetto, where them devils play
(Oh why did I have to cause you pain)
Brat!
I fucking sprayed your crew
Ese I don't give a fuck you know I smoke a few

[Hook]
The devil's inside
The devil's inside
The devil's inside my heart
The devil's inside
The devil's inside
The devil's inside my heart
Leading my mind astray
Twisting everything I say!
How can I fight
The devil inside my heart

[Verse 2]
The Feds got involved when I crossed state lines
Came through the check point, my bitch pushing the ride
Ese twenty DEAs want to find the camp
But they stuck on the ass, so they told us to pass
One point five in the fucking stash
Mothafucker do the math, went through it back to back
You get snatched and never seen again
Conejo be the reaper, rhyme flow get deeper
Cause who in the game done it quite like I?
(No one can do it better)
I think for a second, no one﻿ quite like I
Gots to kill me twice, gotta cap in the night
Apocalypse now, I put them city lights out
I bang on lames and make their artist look soft
Expose every single one for nothing more than a front
I lit chronic blunts and blew the smoke in their face
West L.A. was the place where I caught my case

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's like 2 High say, gang banging's tradition
The block steady plotting while your partners is dropping
The Feds copping, ese the new L.P
The new C.D. is for the felons like me
The streets want to know what's the harps with Rabbs
Collabos with the G is custom made for the gangs
The realist and it's been recognized
Homie any record droppin sixteen with my squad
They ask why, cause I'm willing to ride
In this world full of sin where I'm whipping this white
In the killing field of dreams, vatos ain't what they seem
My homies caught one, he put down on his team
Is what I mean, it's already foreseen
Ese vatos full of scheme, putting thoughts were it be
That's how we breath, in this city of mine
And this the introduction to Los﻿ Angeles Times

[Hook]
