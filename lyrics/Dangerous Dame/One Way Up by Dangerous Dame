[ VERSE 1: Dangerous Dame ]
I got a message, and it's directed to the blackman
About the time to get your mind up out the garbage can
Cause what you're thinkin is wrong
That's why I'm singin this song
To bring you along the path where knowledge is born
Now understand that you're broke, mane
The worst move you can make is gettin in the dope game
Cars, money and girls and clothes
Yeah, these are the flammy things this life holds, right?
It looks good from the outside, but on the inside you're goin for a rough ride
Crack kills and happiness it will never bring
That ain't the way to go up cause it's a devil thing
How could you like to live a life so dirty
Knowin that you'll never even last pass 30
You're livin in luxury but steppin on the life of another bra?
There's only one way up

One way
One way up

[ VERSE 2: Dangerous Dame ]
G's was clockin, bustin out your socks from ( ? ) the caine
Along with that the jealousy came
Now you're watchin your back any place that you go to
Cause everywhere you look there's a brother to smoke you
You wonder how it happened this way
Cause back in the day it wasn't even like this
Man, you think: damn!
You got your cash now they ask for a portion
They gank you for your bank but you can call it extortion
Breathin down your neck so much you're catchin the blues
Sayin that you didn't pay community dues
Yeah, death threats on the phone every night
If you can't pay the price then they'll be takin your life
Now you're scared, can't even think about sleep
Your live illegal, whoops, can't even call the police
When you got in the game, man, you was pressin your luck
That's not the way to be livin, huh? (No) There's only one way up

One way
One way up

One way, brothers

One way
One way up

One way, sisters

One way
One way up

No more killin, no more dealin

One way
One way up

The sky's the limit if you choose it

[ VERSE 3: Dangerous Dame ]
You got the choice of two, so what you wanna do
It's on you to listen to my point of view
Or either stay on the wrong track and go down
(Where?) Where the fire is found
It's called hell, and the other place is called heaven
Whoever said you need a preacher or a reverend?
God's ears will always open if you're speakin
No matter if you're white, red, brown or Puerto-Rican
But what I'm preachin is simple to learn
(There's a heaven and hell, you only get one turn)
It's time to make that change just like the man in the mirror
Straighten up your life so you can see a little clearer
Doin crime, sellin crack and gettin murder raps
Now tell me, do you always wanna live like that?
(Nah) Well, stay away from stupid stuff
There's a lot of ways down, but only one way up
