Chorus: Chiko Dateh
Move your body closer to me baby (Hey lady)
Just chill right here with me (Chill right here with me)
I'm not asking you to get me yet, babe
I just wanna get
To know you (Hey lady)

(Verse 1)
[Rebel] What's crack-a-latin'
Baby girl, let's get to perculatin'
Fuck debatin', nigga, time for playa-hatin'
Let's spend a little time and see how close we can get
Got the chronic, hydrobonic and a bottle of Moet
What your name, what your size, what's the color of your eyes
Sayin' every little thing to get you wet between the thighs
I'm a player
Droppin' up game for the triple
Out to make a grip out of shiny dime and nickel
[Chiko] Hey lady
[Rebel] Move a little closer, shorty
Let's shake up the party cause it's time to get naughty
On the real
This is how I feel
I give up a mil, just so I could steal
A second of your time and let you feel the passion of a thug
Me and you lay down on the bed, skin rub
Rebel the don and D-Double
At The Backhouse, E-Dubb and C-Bubble

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Dominator]
Move a closer
Let me connect
Dig up in your valley
Touch you where you're wet
All the right spots, we connecting all them dots
We been smoking on that pot, baby, please forget-me-not
I know you got plans and I know you got places
You wanna go too, but you keep making these faces
That make me wanna ask you to stay
And be my lady
Do a lot of screwin'
But not have many babies
Me and you, baby girl, against the world
I'm not askin' you to give me nothin'
Plain and simple, girl
Unless you want the Dominator to break it down, way down
Turn your punani into a smile from a frown
I'm not supposed to be so nasty
But I can't help myself
Thinking of how you could jab me
Of course, you the one, who else
Got them soft hands
I could smell the funk in your fingernails

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Madogg]
You'se a class act woman
Beautiful baby
Song in my head, ringin' "Who's that lady?"
Tell me your name
Forget your number
A drink on me, let's get to know one another
Sippin' on Cris
Champagne
Beautiful soft skin, your body's callin' my name
I'll give you everything, I need nothin'
All I want is to show you my lovin'
I ain't bluffing
I'll give you the world
There ain't no limit
If you was my girl
Drink that ice, you look nice and sexy
Naughty little grin, lookin' sweet and nasty
I'm happy
For this very night
Starlit sky clearing up to take flight
To ecstacy, girl
You and me
The love is strong til eternity
Hey lady

Repeat Chorus
