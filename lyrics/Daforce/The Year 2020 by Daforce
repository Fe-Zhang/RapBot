DEATH MIND COLLIDING AIN'T NO CHOICE TO ENTER FOLKS BE HIDING K9'S SEARCH EM DOWN

CHORUS

THE YEAR 2020

RAP

THIS BATTLES DESIGNED FOR CELEBRITY MCS, SET UP BY THE PEOPLES TO RUN THE INDUSTRY
NOW YOUR RAPPING FOR YOUR LIFE IN A COLISEUM THE YEAR 2020 ROBOTS REPLACE HUMAN BEINGS
RAPPERS LOCKED DOWN LIKE A CAMP IN DEPRESSION, NO SUCH THINGS AS RECORD COMPANIES
OR STUDIO SESSIONS, CAGED MATCHES CUZ ITS ON NO STUMBLING MISTAKES DISQUALIFICATION
MEANS THAT YOUR GONE, YOUR MINDS BEEN REPROGRAMED TO FIGHT DARES NO LOVE UP IN
HERE TONIGHT AND IF YOUR OUTTA LINE YOUR GETTING ZAPPS BY THE 357 PHAZER GATS
AND IF YOUR GOOD ENOUGH THAT MEANS YOU CAN WORK FOR THE BOSS, YOUR BETTER OFF
LIKE THAT THAN GETTING TOSSED YOU GOTTA DIG AND PUSH SOME BOULDERS AND IF YOU REFUSE
YOU SEE FIRING SQUADS OVER YOUR SHOULDER

CHORUS

THE YEAR 2020

RAP

IF YOU LOSE YOUR BATTLE YOUR LOCKED UP IN ISOLATION, THEN THE NEXT DAY TERMINATION
INFRONT OF THE WHOLE NATION, CUZ RAPS BECOME A SPORT ON SATELLITE TV 30 SECONDS
TO MOURN HERE COMES A PRIEST WITH A CB, CHANGING MY FLOWS THEY BE SCANNING MY MIND
PREDICTING THE NEXT RHYME BUT I GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR THEM THIS TIME
GOTTA STAY ALIVE WITH MY INTA-LECT, THEY ALREADY THINK IM GONNA START MY RHYME WITH A
MIC CHECK, NOW YOU KNOW HOW MANY MC'S WOULDA BEEN DEAD ALREADY, THEY ENTER THE DOME
NIGHTMARES LIKE FREDDY, THEY SWITCH UP THE BEAT TRY TO CHANGE MY FLOW, BUT THEY COULDN'T MESS
ME UP THO CUZ I KICKED IT SLO, YEA SHACKLED FROM ANKLES TO WRIST, RAPPING BOUT FROM THE ABYSS
FROM HEAD TO TOE SWET DRENCHES, SQUARE AFF TELL YOUR BO SSS THAT I SENT THIS

IT THE YEAR 2020 NOT TOO FRIENDLY..........
