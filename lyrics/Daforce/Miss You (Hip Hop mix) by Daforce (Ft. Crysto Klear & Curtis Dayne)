You was always on my mind, should have never let you go
You know im gonna make it up to you
You was always on my mind, should have never let you go
Now I know what it is to miss you

Nobody can make me do things I dont want to do
And for nobody I would change, coz I got you girl
And I wish I had known before stuff im getting now
I know that I could move the world just to make you smile
I feel what you feel but thats just me
Never knew how much id miss you girl

You was always on my mind, should have never let you go
You know im gonna make it up to you
You was always on my mind, should have never let you go
Now I know what it is to miss you

Nobody can make me say, im commited to you
For nobody I would fight, xcept for you girl
And I hope id forever be what youre looking for
And if theres anything you want anything you want
You just come to me I feel what you feel but thats just me
Never knew how much id miss you girl

You was always on my mind, should have never let you go
You know im gonna make it up to you
You was always on my mind, should have never let you go
Now I know what it is to miss you

Ill never let ill never let you go
And I donno why, I must have been in a very bad place
Everything is clear now
