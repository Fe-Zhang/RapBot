Intro:

Unknown Source,  daforce dog presents,   go go go Crysto




Rap:

Walk up in the spot, ladys look hot, music gonna pop, The bars getting rocked
And we ain't gone stop till 3 hits clock, R & B, reggae, cylpso and hip hop
So shake what u want, shake what you got, I dont buy quickly i was taught to shop
Your stock has dropped and ive seen your goods, and a flops a flop



Chorus

To the ladies infront of the club show me some love yo, Crysto
To the fellaz in the back of the club so go get yours
Hip hop the drinks iz on us so dont sip slow
The drinks is on us so go go go



Rap

Got a heineken in one hand, jack in the other, puffin on a cuban cigar
Pass to my brotha, we ain't even hit the v.i.p yet suckas, but i dont mind
The bumper to bumper sweet like honey butter backside thumper
White pants wearing dry humper, throw crumbs to a rat coming out the gutter
Damn dog u gotta love em, gotta love em



Chorus

To the ladies infront of the club show us some love yo, Crysto
To the fellaz in the back of the club so go get yours
The drinks iz on us so dont sip slow
The drinks is on us so go go go




Bridge

I  dont need the sign




Chorus

To the ladies infront of the club show us some love yo, Crysto
To the fellaz in the back of the club so go get yours
The drinks iz on us so dont sip slow
The drinks is on us so go go go
