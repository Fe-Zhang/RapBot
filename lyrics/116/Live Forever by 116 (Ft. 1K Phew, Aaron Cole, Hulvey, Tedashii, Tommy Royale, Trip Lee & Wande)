[Intro: Abe Parker]
I'm gonna live forever
De Lassana Oh

[Verse 1: Wande & Lecrae]
Ayy, I hit the block, yeah
I'm talking holy when I say I push the rock, yeah
I keep it moving, it's a movement, can't be stopped, yeah
My life a movie, must be why they tryna plot, yeah
They must forgot, yeah, yeah (Lemme talk to 'em)
My God is poppin', there really no stopping
I hop in the coffin, I'm living like "poof"
Really, I got it with no other option
You livin' in Gotham while I live in truth, ooh
Really, uh, they think it's odd like I'm Timmy, yeah
Talking that life, I'm like: "Give me", yeah
I live forever infiny

[Chorus: Wande & Trip Lee]
We gon' live forever now (Yeah)
We gon' live forever now (It's lit)
With You Lord we're better, yeah (Ayy) (Huh)
Unashamed forever (Yessuh)
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Off with my squad, full of zealots, you can't tell a thing (Huh)
Yelling "Yessuh," ain't no fetish for amphetamines (Yuh)
Ain't no day of expiration, this that evergreen (Woo)
Death is heading for us, but we yelling "Where the sting?"
Bump a song, but my soul never fall off (Fall off)
Call me Paul 'cause of Saul, it got sawed-off (Sawed-off)
All the glory I would haul, it got hauled off (Woo)
Second birthday, my death day was called off
Threw my pride in the red, count it all loss
Split the sea, so my path has been walled off
Ask me why I'm feeling bold: 'cause I've been delivered (Yeah)
I bow down to Him, who killed the killer

[Chorus: Wande]
We gon' live forever now (Yeah)
We gon' live forever now (It's lit)
With You Lord we're better, yeah (Ayy)
Unashamed forever (Yeah)
Yeah, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Wande]
You know I can't believe
Thought it was all a dream
Felt like consequence
Now I'm finally free
We gon' live forever now
Unashamed forever, yeah

[Verse 3: 1K Phew & WHATUPRG]
I wanna live (I do), heaven and earth the crib (Heaven and earth)
Still in the field (I am), time to go kick the squib (Time to go kick)
I'm on the grill (Huh), time to go flip the ribs (Flip)
Lot of respect from bets, I told you we next, I'm callin' my dibs
Waited around for numbers to leave the house, and then run in the spot (Ready to run)
Used to go deal some money when I was at Stevenson, then we got caught (Used to go)
Now I believe in Jesus, Jesus, Jesus: why would I not? (Hey why would I not?)
Even though that what I said, they shakin' they head, but guess what I got? (Guess what)
I got the faith with me for real (Real)
Give me the plate, the grace, the meal (Meal)
Look in the sky, the big reveal (Reveal)
Give us some doubt to make the deal (Deal)
He got the slug, the Louisville ('Ville)
I'm with the guy from Pleasant Hill (Holy)
And I came in with the soldiers
You better not run-up on one of these soldiers

[Chorus: Wande]
We gon' live forever now (Yeah)
We gon' live forever now (It's lit)
With You Lord we're better, yeah (Ayy)
Unashamed forever (Yeah)
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 4: Aaron Cole]
Look, uh, can I reflect? Yeah
He brought my moms out the wreck, yeah
Brought my pops out the hood
Isn't he good? How can I forget this my calling
They been cappin', you can bank that, we been snappin'
Lord for me it's automatic, yeah, it's Jesus over status, ayy, yeah
Now me and my mom is good
Crazy I waited for this moment, bless, that's understood (Yeah)
Even if God didn't do it, homie, I knew He could (Yeah)
I'm steady winning over demons like I knew I would, oh

[Verse 5: Hulvey]
I gotta testify (Testify)
Yeah, I'm so free, gotta live for Him for the rest of my life (The rest of my life)
Sometimes, you just don't see it when He's blessing your life
Uh, don't wanna miss it no more (No more)
Got my knees to the floor (Floor)
Yeah, it's time to go to war (Carvello)
I got so much on my mind, I coulda blacked out (Blacked out)
I was workin' at the store, I took the trash out (Trash out)
I found true beauty in the rain
I found true peace in the pain
Put my whole life on the line for Him
When you live for Him, then you'll die for Him

[Chorus: Wande]
We gon' live forever now (Yeah)
We gon' live forever now (It's lit)
With You Lord we're better, yeah (Ayy)
Unashamed forever (Yeah)
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 6: Tommy Royale]
Esto fue P-L-A-N, parte del plan
Me paré en Texas con la Biblia en el dash (Trrah)
Dijo, "You was going fast" (Ey)
Dije, "Mala mía" (Wuh)
I’m just never gon' die and His grace is long last (Tommy)
Pa' la cultura, jugando con esdrújulas (Ooh-wee)
No seas víctima, leyendo mal la brújula
Cuando llamé a mami dije, "Llama la prensa"
Por mis poca vergüenza, ahora soy sin vergüenza

[Verse 7: Tedashii]
He gave my life, like husband and wife, I told Him I stand by that
Like thief in the night, this thing gotta sight, no way that I'm backing back, wooh
Exile if I left, told 'Crae to feed the meter
Since '05 it go down, that new school, we the leaders

[Chorus: Wande & Tedashii]
We gon' live forever now (Yeah)
Live forever now
We gon' live forever now (It's lit)
I'm living heaven-bound
With You Lord we're better, yeah (Ayy)
I'm feelin' better now
Unashamed forever (Yeah)
You came down, but won't let us down
Yeah, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Wande, Tedashii, & Both]
You know I can't believe (Yeah)
Thought it was all a dream (Yeah)
Felt like consequence (Yeah)
Now I'm finally free (Yeah)
We gon' live forever now
Unashamed forever, yeah
