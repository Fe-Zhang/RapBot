[Verse 1]
I'm loving life fam, we in the light man
Yeah that's right fam, another Christ jam
We get it hype man, I'm just a hypeman
Jesus the Headliner, I'm just His hypeman
So get it right fam, it's not about your boy
But if you with the truth, holla at ya boy fam
My past was gritty and filthy like a trashcan
But through His blood, I'm cleaner than a snowman
This not a show man, but this fo sho man
At His wedding, He saving me for a slow dance
So I'm gon slow dance, down the narrow with Him
The whole way fam, like I'm hearing slow jamz
Our soul programed, this is program
Out with the old man, in with the new man
Follow the trails He left us like Toucan Sam
1 and 2, this one is for you fam

[Hook]
If you walking down the streets
Or you riding with your top down
Repping on the frontline
A soldier in the background
You face the trials of this world
And you don't back down
You hear the word of the Lord
And go and act out
You get down to the Fathers biz
Want the whole world to know Who Jesus is
If you loving the fact that Jesus lives
And the fact that Jesus is
Act Out

[Verse Two]
Let's keep it hype man, I'm just a hypeman
Yeah that's right fam, another Christ jam
Abundant life fam, we in the light fam
We just some broken vessels repping the GodMan
A tool in God's hand, like Moses' rod
Or the mic that I hold in my right hand
Like the Psalmist, His word we delight man
Rejoice and we write man, all about Christ fam
Let's keep it moving, don't get entangled
In everyday life, keep your focus on God's plan
Forsake the world's plan and the things they covet
Forget a Spring Bling fam and a Summer Jam
But this a summer jam, but believe me dun
I could care less if they bump this in their Hummers man
The plan's for us is to shed light like the summer man
...

[Verse 3]
Yeah that's right man, this that Christ jam
Jesus the GodMan, seated at the right hand
Whether you walking down the street or at a light man
Sitting in your room, about to make a right man
Guard your life fam, and forsake the things of this world
Keep your focus on God's plan
Because our life supposed to bring light man
To lead people out of the dark to the GodMan
