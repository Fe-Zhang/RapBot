[Chorus: Evan and Eris]
It's gonna be the best time of the year
(Ayy)
Got my hands in the sky ’cause I know that I'm living my best life when you're near
This Christmas
Toast to the memories through the years
I know I got better days ahead, but I’m loving this moment right here (Moment right here)
This Christmas
This day right here
Right here, yeah, yeah (Right here, right here)
This moment here
Right here, yeah, yeah
This Christmas right here

[Verse 1: Jaylon Ashaun]
All I want for Christmas is a little snow (Little snow)
You beside the fire with some mistletoe
Grandma screaming, "Grab your jacket, boy, you know it's cold!"
Give me that sweet potato pie with all the dinner rolls (Ayy, yo)
Go turn up the music this your favorite song (Ayy, yo)
Go grab all your cousins, we gon' sing along
'Cause we're so glad you're home
It's been way too long
Since I told you, "I love you"
Since I looked you in the eyes and I hugged you
Since I told you that you special to me
Because sometimes the people on your family tree is the best gift that you ever received, and that's real

[Chorus: Evan and Eris]
It’s gonna be the best time of the year
(Ayy)
Got my hands in the sky ’cause I know that I'm living my best life when you’re near
This Christmas
Toast to the memories through the years
I know I got better days ahead, but I'm loving this moment right here (Moment right here)
This Christmas
This day right here
Right here, yeah, yeah (Right here, right here)
This moment here (With you right here)
Right here, yeah, yeah (Right here, right here, right here, right here)
This Christmas right here

[Verse 2: Jon Keith]
Yeah, I'm feeling the joy, can't fight it (Fight it)
I don’t know nothing else like it (Like it)
Looking back, it was tough, man, you don't know (Yeah)
Get a cup, fill it up with some cocoa (Whoa)
I ain't worried 'bout no present when I got You present
My momma in the kitchen, I call that a special blessing
Pops sitting at the table, that's a miracle
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow, we got here right now (Yeah, yeah)
You never know, so you gotta keep the fam tight
It's real cold, so the fire burning all night
We took some L's this year, but we alright, we alright

[Chorus: Evan and Eris]
It's gonna be the best time of the year
(Ayy)
Got my hands in the sky 'cause I know that I'm living my best life when you're near
This Christmas (This Christmas)
Toast to the memories through the years
I know I got better days ahead, but I'm loving this moment right here (Moment right here)
This Christmas (Right here, right here, right here, right here)
Oh, right here
