[Intro]
We still crossing over man
They still gon hate us cause they hated Him first
And I'm still in the same place dawg

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm still in the Church
Focused and alert
No suit and tie still got the t-shirt
I'm into praising God cause He made us out of dirt
And plus He gave His life for this world's evil works
Now flirt with that
Most of y'all can't jerk with that
Cause it ain't no benefits and no perks with that
Still gotta live your life on this earth with that
But we live eternally and I can work with that
I lie, yeah I cheated, yeah I lust within
But guess what?
That's why I trust in Him
See you thinking that you ain't that bad
You just lying to yourself playboy
You better check your health
While you're all about the cash and ice
Hope you ready for change
You just broke the first commandment twice
And I know that you done stole before
If it wasn't a gun
It was some gum from the grocery store
It's all sin to God, man look into God
You guilty, you ain't even a friend of God
Sin gotta high price it'll cost your life
But God fit that bill on the cross with Christ

[Hook]
Crossover
From death to life man
What's the hold up accept the Christ man
We flex the mic to rep for Christ
So we can put your soul at rest tonight

[Verse 2]
I don't catch the Spirit, I'm all filled up
I can't lose it either, I'm all sealed up
And you can bet your life that I'ma rep for Christ
One taste He'll get you right
Folks is
Thinking they Christian but when they sinning they don't
Feel the conviction that the
Spirit is giving and they
Keep living life like that's cool with me
Y'all dudes ain't fooling me
Try to play me to the left like I'm trying to get deep on em
This is real talk dawg you better peep something
This ain't that philosophic rap like homonym
And I ain't talking bout the God you heard about from mom and em
Put the blunt out dawg, put down the Heineken
Man God understands
What? Come again
I guess you think that God is kinda like yo mama huh
Like He ain't even tripping on your sinning and your drama

[Verse 3]
Look life's way more then ice and rims
If you don't make enough to pay the price of sin
And God's gon judge you dawg, that's reality
Saying you don't believe is like saying there ain't no gravity
Then running off to go jump a cliff
When you hit the ground tell me what you get
Why you running from the freedom of the Gospel
You hostile, you're looking like you're Lucifer's apostle
But God got you, and though we all deserve death
He still keep putting breath in your nostrils
But you treat Him like an obstacle
See Him come at your convenience like a Stop-N-Go
Waiting for a sweeter deal or a sign or something
Like God ain't come down and die or something
Trust me dawg God wants the best for you
That's why the Gospel of Christ is addressed to you
