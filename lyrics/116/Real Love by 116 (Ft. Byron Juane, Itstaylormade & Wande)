[Verse 1: Taylor Made]
I don't understand it
How you gave it all away
Don't know how you manage
To keep holding it down for me
Goodness and mercy
It's on me, it's on me
Your love is my favorite
Unchanging
[?][0:26] inside
Got a joy, I can't deny it
Something got me feeling right
Heart is like an open fire
This time of year
We can't forget
Who gave the gift

[Chorus: Taylor Made]
On the first day of Christmas
You gave it all up
Ain't that some real love?
Ain't that some real love?
Don't need a wish list
Got all that I want
You gave me real love
You gave me real love
Real (Real), real love
(Real), real (Real), real love

[Verse 2: Wande & Byron Juane]
I don't understand it (No, no, no)
Why you never give up on me (Yeah)
Love everlasting (Uh-huh)
So I'ma let the whole world see
Your [?][1:16] and Your patience
So good and so gracious
Don't laugh when I say this
Say this
[?][1:24] inside
Got a joy, I can't deny it
Something got me feeling right
Heart is like an open fire
This time of year
We can't forget
Who gave the gift

[Chorus: Taylor Made & Byron Juane]
On the first day of Christmas
You gave it all up
Ain't that some real love?
Ain't that some real love?
Don't need a wish list
Got all that I want
You gave me real love
You gave me real love
Real (Real), real love
(Real), real (Real), real love

[Bridge: Wande]
What more do I need?
When I got You I feel complete
I can feel Your presence around me
It's the best gift under the tree, yeah
What more do I need?
When I got You I feel complete
I can feel Your presence around me
It's the best gift under the tree, yeah

[Chorus: Taylor Made & Byron Juane]
On the first day of Christmas
You gave it all up
Ain't that some real love?
Ain't that some real love?
Don't need a wish list
Got all that I want
You gave me real love
You gave me real love
Real (Real love), real love
(That real), real (That real), real love
Real (That real love), real love
Real (That real), real love
