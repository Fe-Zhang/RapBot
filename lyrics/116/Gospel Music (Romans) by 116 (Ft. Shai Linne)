[Intro] (spoken)
Uh, soli Deo gloria, uh. Once again. Thirteen letters! Yeah. It's the book of Romans right hear y'all! Here we go!

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

[Verse 1]
Awake from your slumber, rise, a letter from the wise
The book of Romans, the Christian faith summarized
By Paul, a bondservant of Christ Jesus
Called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel
Chapter one, sixteen and seventeen is the thesis
'Cause our sins are colossal, hearts are harder than fossils
That's everybody's plight, can't' solve it, goodnight
How do sinners get right in a Holy God's sight?
Amazing is the answer, see: Romans states it candidly
The first three chapters: God's case against humanity
Whether it's idolatry or religious hypocrisy
No one can possibly see the charges and say, "It's not for me"
Everybody's guilty, everybody's filthy
Before God on judgment day is where everybody will be
For those who believe in Jesus who suffered and died, yo
(It feels so good to be justified)

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

[Verse 2]
Yo, at the cross the wrath of God was spent on Jesus
On behalf of all who repent and believe this
We receive His perfect righteousness
In exchange, believers cursed lives are His
Behold the blessedness for Earth's cold residents
Chapter four, Paul defends it from the Old Testament
Up to this point, we saw the need for justification
In chapter five and following, we see it's implications
In service and purity, we yearn for maturity
Empowered by Christ, who gives eternal security
Slowly but surely, He removes every vice
Raised to newness of life through our union with Christ
But chapter seven finds us strugglin' with sin
It's buggin' us within but He loves us to the end
Even with complications through sin's occupation
For God's consecrated there's no condemnation
The Holy Spirit inside, He comforts like no other
He convinces us we're God's children even when we suffer
Nothing in creation could ever separate us
From the love of God in Christ Jesus who saved us
In chapter nine we see God is sovereign in His mercy
His dealings with Israel shows He's working out His purposes
By the end of eleven it's Jew and Gentile together
United in Christ to His glory forever (forever)

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

[Verse 3]
Yo, so in view of God's mercies
We remove our worldly uniforms and throw on crucified jerseys
Holy and acceptable, ruled by the Divine (Jesus)
Being transformed by renewal of the mind
Yeshua's design, obedience to the Scriptures
With love as the key ingredient in the mixture
The godly man's picture under the new covenant
Mindful of God, we submit to the goverment
Not passing judgment on weaker brothers
Instead, we spread love to them to keep them from stumbling
When we do this, God will truly then smile
As Christ is glorified through Jew and Gentile
And the God of peace at His judgment seat
Will soon crush Satan under our feet (no doubt)
Now this is just an overview, go and read Romans through
And I pray the God of Romans will grab a hold of you

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

I'm not ashamed of the gospel, y'all
It's the power of God which can save us all
In the gospel, the righteousness of God's revealed
And who lives by faith? The righteous will

[Outro] (spoken)
So that's it man. The book of Romans. But yo, don't just take my word for it. Yo, when this is over, grab the Word and read it for yourself. You gotta get into God's Word, and get God's Word into you. There's a lot of good commentaries out there, grab one. My man John MacArthur, uh, Leon Morris, James Boyce, R. C. Sproul. Gotta get into God's Word, y'all. Grace and peace to the 1-1-6. Yeah, we out. Uh
