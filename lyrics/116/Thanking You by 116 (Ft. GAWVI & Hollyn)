[Verse 1: Hollyn]
Stayin' up 'til morning breaks
Ain't no such thing as too late
All the stress from our nine to five
Won't let it faze me when it's Christmas time
Anybody told you nothin' matters like it's 'posed to?
No heartbreak, no mistakes, no wrong
I'ma celebrate my favorite birthday
And even if I have the worst day
I know that there's better to come

[Chorus: Hollyn]
Won't let nothing hold me down
When I'm in the Christmas mood
Look at the joy I found
So, Jesus, I'm thanking You
Yeah, I'm thanking You
Yeah, I'm thanking You
Yeah, I'm thanking You (Oh yeah)
Yeah, I'm thanking You
Yeah, I'm thanking You

[Verse 2: GAWVI]
I know I've been tripping all night
Even though I see you close by
Money looking real tight, I just want to cry (Yeah, yeah)
It's Christmas time (Oh-oh)
I can't lose my joy over little things I don't symbolize
Your great love, love (Love)
Would You help me focus my eyes on You? (Oh)
Majesty (Majesty), King of kings (King of kings)
Holy, You are, we'll say

[Chorus: Hollyn, GAWVI, & Both]
Won't let nothing hold me down
When I'm in the Christmas mood (In the Christmas mood)
Look at the joy I found
So, Jesus, I'm thanking You (Yeah, I'm thanking You)
I'm thanking You (Thanking You), thanking You
I'm thanking, I'm thanking You, yeah, I'm thanking You
Thanking You, thanking You, yeah, I'm thanking
Yeah, I'm thanking You
