[Intro: WHATUPRG]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: SVRCINA]
Oh, what a time
The stars are brightly shining
It was the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Pre-Chorus: WHATUPRG]
(Oh, what a time)
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
On the ground I live
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of kings
(Oh, what a time)
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
On the ground I live
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of Kings
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
On the ground I live
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of kings

[Chorus: SVRCINA]
Oh, what a time
The stars are brightly shining
It was the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Post-Chorus: WHATUPRG]
Oh, what a time
Oh, what a time
Holy divine
All must align
Greater than wine
Oh, what a time
Holy divine
All must align

[Bridge: WHATUPRG]
Got a lot of stress, and a lot of pain
But we all alive, and we all okay
It's a holiday, it's a holiday
Thank God for the holiday
Got a lot of stress, and a lot of pain
But we all alive, and we all okay
It's a holiday, it's a holiday
Thank God for the holiday

[Pre-Chorus: WHATUPRG]
(Oh, what a time)
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
On the ground I live
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of kings

[Chorus: SVRCINA & WHATUPRG]
Oh, what a time
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
The stars are brightly shining
On the ground I live
It was the night of our dear Savior's birth
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of kings
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
On the ground I live
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of kings

[Outro: WHATUPRG]
You're the King of kings
Giving everything, everything
