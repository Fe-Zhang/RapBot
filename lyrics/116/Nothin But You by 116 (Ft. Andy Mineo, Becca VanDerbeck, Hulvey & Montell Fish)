[Intro]
He-he-here we go now
He-here, okay okay
He-he-here we go now
He-here, okay okay, ayy

[Verse 1: Hulvey]
I see a lot of window shopping at a store
I talk about the Lord and then I buy some more
But that don't fill the gaps, it never has before
Get way too attached to things we cannot afford
It's Christmas, I got my knees to the floor
With my arms wide open, Lord, rock me to my core, yeah
What's the point of holding onto things that fade away?
I'd rather have You, Jesus, forever You gon' reign

[Pre-Chorus: Montell Fish]
And all we want is You
And all we need is You
The trees and the lights
But we surrender our lives (C'mon)
Yeah, all we want is You (C'mon, hey)
Yeah, all we need is You (C'mon, c'mon)
The trees and the lights
But we surrender our lives

[Chorus: Becca VanDerbeck]
Arms wide open
Expecting nothing but You
When I give it all away
That's when I find the change
I don't have the words to say
Expecting nothing but You

[Post-Chorus]
He-he-here we go now
He-here, okay okay
Y-You, Y-You
He-he-here we go now
He-here, okay okay, ayy (Hey, yeah)

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
It's that time of the year so wifey play Mariah
It's a tradition watching Christmas Story by the fire
The meal ready so we feast like kings
Am I the only one that put cranberry sauce on everything?
Post-meal food coma, then we watch the game
Googling what gym membership we gon' do again
The fam together even those who think the opposite
We keep the peace as long as we ain't talking politics
But, however, you decide to spend it
I hope you get a chance to chill and remember the message
God gave us His son, that's the greatest present
That's the reason why we give 'em and get 'em the gift, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Montell Fish]
And all we want is You (C'mon, hey)
And all we need is You (C'mon, c'mon)
The trees and the lights
But we surrender our lives

[Chorus: Becca VanDerbeck]
Arms wide open
Expecting nothing but You
When I give it all away
That's when I find the change
I don't have the words to say
Expecting nothing but You

[Outro]
He-he-here we go now
He-here, okay okay
Y-You, Y-You
He-he-here we go now
He-here, okay okay, ayy
