[Verse 1]
How do you mend a broken world?
Give it a gift it could never earn
Pour out a love that it don't deserve
Send it a Son and a Savior

[Chorus]
It was a silent night
A holy night
All was calm
And all was bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild

[Post-Chorus]
Hush, hush
I hear the clouds speak, sing of His glory, singin'
Hush, hush
I see the sky part, showin' the Father's heart, singin'
Hush, hush
I see the stars bow, Heaven is smiling down, singin'
Hush, hush
Making my wrongs right, bringing me life on a silent night

[Bridge]
Oh
On a silent night
Mmm

[Verse 2]
How do you repay the gift of life?
What's the return on a sacrifice?
Oh yeah
'Cause silver and gold won't suffice
No, no
So I'm giving my heart as my reply

[Chorus]
It was a silent night
A holy night
All was calm
And all was bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild

[Post-Chorus]
Hush, hush
I hear the clouds speak, sing of His glory, singin'
Hush, hush
I see the sky part, showin' the Father's heart, singin'
Hush, hush
I see the stars bow, Heaven is smiling down, singin'
Hush, hush
Making my wrongs right, giving me life

[Post-Chorus]
Hush, hush
I hear the clouds speak-sing of His glory, singin'
Hush, hush
I see the clouds part, showin' the Father's heart, singin'
Hush, hush
I see the stars bow, Heaven is smiling down, singin'
Hush, hush
Making my wrongs right, giving me life on a silent night

[Outro]
Oh, onto them a child is born
A Son is given on a silent night
All the glory, all the honor
On a silent night
