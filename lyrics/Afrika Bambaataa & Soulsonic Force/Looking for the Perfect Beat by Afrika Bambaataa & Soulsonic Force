Students, of the music, at every single age
Must exercise the quotes of Shakespeare, with this life upon a stage
When we say life you know that's right, has a meaning
Our music keeps on pleasing
And all the things that we wanna keep teasin’, teasin’, teasin’, teasin’

Looking for the perfect beat, people

Stop a futuristic hit dance, just party (Get loose, get loose)
Every time we get into it, makes us wheel and deal
Brings out the very best in us, that is for real

Now this is what you gotta do (This is what you gotta do)
This is a thing you must to, round up!

Music is a must, the rhythm moves the women
To a spacy romantic ocean that shows they’re high potent
At the spur of every moment there’s a space at your parade
With the psychadelic shades, make you party harty everybody

This is a thing you must to, round up!
