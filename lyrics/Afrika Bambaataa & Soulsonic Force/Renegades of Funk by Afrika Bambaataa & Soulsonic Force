[Intro]
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now

Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age for renegades

[Verse 1]
Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
When the earth kept going through changes
Then the renaissance came, times continued to change
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of their time and age
The mighty renegades

[Hook]
Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades

[Verse 2]
From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singing electronic chants
Like astrology
Like tricknology
Like God's Creation
Like the Zulu station
Like to the nation
Like destroy all nations
Like militants
Like down in sand
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same
Oh renegades

[Verse 3]
Now renegades are people with their own philosophy
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
You know they have their secret notions
And time is endless motion
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time
A state of mind and a sense of pride
A renegade, yes a renegade
Of this time and age
So many renegades

[Hook]
Who's that
Now hand clap
The renegades

[Verse 4]
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
(Repeat)

[Verse 5]
We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of
Electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh

[Verse 6]
There was a time when our music
Was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down on the Bay sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force
We're talking about Mr. B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age
So many renegades
What's that
It's a hand clap
The renegade

[Outro]
Just jam sucker
Say jam sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say groove, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Say dance, sucker
Now move, sucker
Now move, sucker

Everybody say
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Shake that thing
That makes me swing
I got some great
He's a renegade of funk
Mr. Biggs
He's a renegade of funk
Bambaataa
He's a renegade of funk
Pow Wow
He's a renegade of funk
And MC Globe
