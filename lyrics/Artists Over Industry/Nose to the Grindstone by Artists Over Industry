[Chorus]
Top secret nobody can see, we got secrets nobody believes
Nobody but speech we zone off greez the high off the trees fly like the breeze
The mind is the key, to unlock it, completely off the wall a little out of pocket
Nose to the grindstone, lets make a profit, were winnin with this process

[Inkwell the Biologic]
While pickin a pack of blunts to grab
My mind was suddenly stabbed by something utterly sad
Kids these days are dying sole fact they wanna be bad
Of course they wanna see cash and never wanna be trash
Living below the richest class is a contradiction to gettin cash
Life is a trip you need to live it fast
Forget about constables and hospitals your obstacles are optical
Nothing stoppin you, youre unstoppable
Propelled by rocket fuel to rocket you to a dollar two
We know you stop to do anything that could possibly profit you
Gawk at who doesnt walk like you or talk like you
Looks to me we're not at fault like you
Prejudging will be the fall of you
You ought not do what you thought to do
Cuz I brought a crew who will walk you through
The removal of all facts you thought you knew

[Chorus]
Top secret nobody can see, we got secrets nobody believes
Nobody but speech we zone off greez the high off the trees fly like the breeze
The mind is the key, to unlock it, completely off the wall a little out of pocket
Nose to the grindstone, lets make a profit, were winnin with this process

[Windchill]
Staring at the sky star gazin
My bars are amazin sicker than sars patients
The hard way is the only way I know
Relaxin to a beat, puffin on hydro
And my flow is sometimes hard to decipher
Like your brain after slaughtering yeager meister
Somebody tame this tiger
Lyrical navy sniper I'm crazy brighter than 80 lighters
Every page is priceless my mental device is nice
In the midst of hype shit you found a crisis
I'm crowned the nicest walkin the earth
Im that strange feeling you get everytime you walk into church
Gettin lost in my verse sure i'll wake up soon
Blackout in january, wake up june
Id dive in my verse but the waters too shallow
Admist the sun, I cast two shadows

[Chorus]
Top secret nobody can see, we got secrets nobody believes
Nobody but speech we zone off greez the high off the trees fly like the breeze
The mind is the key, to unlock it, completely off the wall a little out of pocket
Nose to the grindstone, lets make a profit, were winnin with this  process

[Inkwell the Biologic Verse 2]
Let me pick up where I left off on the isssue
I think I convinced you that the superficial
Is a stupid principle too supercritical
Of peoples who dough is minimal
Who can't afford a pimpmobile, who livin day to day
With little more than two dimes to pave their way
They slave away to pay their way go to church on sunday
To hear what the savior say hopin that one day
The light will make its way to where they staked their claim
Reverse their nuerons infiltrate their brain and take their pain
But until that day when they can finally say
That the work is over and its time for play
They pray thanking whoever for another day of beautiful weather
Stay true and try and make day two unusually better
True happiness is in you, not what you do with your chedder
Or if you bruise your competitor
Quit chasin high priced replacements for spots in your soul that
Have always lied vacant, have patience, nah mean..

[Windchill Verse 2]
I'm only sixteen lines away from being divine/
Should I remind even with stilts you guys only knee high/
Only moments to reply defy laws of gravity when I speak mine
Evil takes over weak minds so we find
No longer on a decline, although its a steep climb
Im a close encounter of each kind reflect on my life each and  everytime speech shine
The least I can give is an ounce of my soul
Cashing in on my huge mountains of gold
Emerged out the cold was seduced by the wind
Why do we cry at birth, we're produced from a sin
Try to find peace within everbody hates the pain
Artists over industry don't mistake the name
Unpredictable the same as rain
Artists over industry and thats our claim to fame

[Chorus]
Top secret nobody can see, we got secrets nobody believes
Nobody but speech we zone off greez the high off the trees fly like the breeze
The mind is the key, to unlock it, completely off the wall a little out of pocket
Nose to the grindstone, lets make a profit, were winnin with this process
