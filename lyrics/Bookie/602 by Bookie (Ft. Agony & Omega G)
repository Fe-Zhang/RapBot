[Intro]
Uh
I like that
Now what we 'bout ta do
Is get up in them speakers
Youknowwhatimsayin?
Representin' the 6-0-2
I go by the name of Bookie
So clear the words
Fo' Life
Ha, ha
Check it out
Uh

[Bookie]
Now whem I come through stompin'
Other niggas thinkin' I'm from Compton
No other niggas lookin' at the locket
But fuck that
I put it down for the A-Z
Bookie
Other niggas clown 'cause they hate me
Don't give a damn cuz I'm loaded
The industry's about ta hear the sound, had the ????
It's goin' on
Upside the dome, peep the niggas song
Bookie 'bout ta bomb, let ya tag along
Try this stuff at home
Damn that you get the breath, hold it
First time I ever touched a mic, I'm like a woof, I knawed it
Sold up, fit a release as I load up
Look at the picture, flippin' the shit around like a twister
So now, you got ta know somethin' venom
Put it in yo chest cuz I'm known ta run up in em
Fittin' em wit the bomb shit, I'm come and rush in wit the new
Who represent the 6-0-2?

[Chorus]
Let it be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos
Be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos

[Agony]
This my mothafuckin' planet like who bac
Who drop shots and red dots
59th Avenue niggas is my pocket
To be honest, when the niggas rollin' down Thomas
I keeps seein' that slang, dippin' them things on the rhinas
Fool it's cool, rollin' down Indian School
We maintain gold thangs, candy paint wit the duels
Cruisin' down Camelback, tight mags on the Cadillac
Wit a fat sack on my lap, in the backpack
Makin' male case clientele, I better bail
Cuz I won't feel safe 'til I'm outta Glendale
And if I fail, nigga, somebody 'gon tell
So I did flip, skip right back ta Maryvale
I keep it locked and wit my homie for that nigga to pop
And don't make me prove the shit by grabbin' the Glock
17 shot red dots, whatever block if you a true
Hustler from the Avenues of 6-0-2

[Chorus]
Let it be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos
Be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos

[Omega G]
Hear rumors about the way of life
In Arizona ain't no copycats, so get it right
We comin' out, give it some time right before your eyes
We bring the life, another city that'll live or die
Full of the hootchies that'll freak you all night long
And niggas wit the heart ta fight yellin' bring it on
Let it be known another city betta be ya warn
Real G's ta represent the heat, valley fever
Inside the fangs of a criminal wit misdemeanors
Not soldiers, but assasins wit black Beamers
Outsiders within' the city, we never seen ya
And steady smackin' your lips, actin' just like we need ya
We got our own, fuck the world cuz we comin' strong
Makin' the mark inside the industry where we belong
I give it down to the people, we be Fo' Life
So throw yo sets up in the air, make em party high
Can't list where you be from on a map of 'Zona
It's happenin' 'til every sides fully blown up
A revolution on the rise, up on every block
Got everybody goin' crazy and pullin' Glocks
]From East ta West, up on the South niggas sellin' rocks
Parkin' lots full of the juvenilles, fuck the cops
And this is what is bound ta happen when I make the muthafuckas speakers pop
Get ready for my revenge, makin' the playa hatas drop

[Chorus]
Let it be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos
Be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos

[Chorus]
Be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos
Be known
Phoenix, Arizona is on
We put it down 'til we fully blown
And when the word gets around
Learn how ta take a beat down
Put the industry in Mobb Town
All the ghettos
