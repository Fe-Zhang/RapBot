[Hook: E.S.G.]
Like this and that, like this and that
Girl you looking good, won't you shake it from the back
Like this and that, like this and that
Southside be holding, Wreckshop on the map
Like this and that, like this and that
All my playas in the front, all my thugs in the back
Like this and that, like this and that
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all

[E.S.G.]
What's up D-Gotti

[D-Gotti]
What up E.S.G
Do you wanna come floss, through the club with me

[E.S.G.]
Should we roll two deep, while I floss in the Lexus

[D-Gotti]
Don't worry bout that, I'm pulling out the compressor

[E.S.G. & D-Gotti]
Mo' wood than a dresser, in both of our cars
Now we some Wreckshop, true to life superstars

[D-Gotti]
Bo'gaurding the bar

[E.S.G.]
For menage tois

[D-Gotti]
Bring em back to the spot, so we get drunk off in the spa

[E.S.G.]
Playa you roll first

[D-Gotti]
They blazing mind, so bump and grind

[E.S.G.]
Let me get that head shot, while you work her damn spine

[D-Gotti & E.S.G.]
Same time, make her scream both of our names
Run trains, like playas did back in the game
Won't you make that thang, roll up on me
It ain't no fun, if I can't share with D-Gotti
Or E.S.G., cause we down like fo' flats
Won't you shake it like this, won't you shake it like that

[E.S.G.'s Hook]

[Ronnie Spencer's Hook]
Shake it like this baby, shake it like that baby
Move it like this baby, move it like that baby
Shake it like this, shake it like that
Move it like this, move it like that
Shake it like this baby, shake it like that baby

[D-Reck]
Ms. Thang Ms. Thang, what you ain't heard
I got superstar status, in this Dirty 3rd
Better yet baby girl, I'm the king of the hill
And I'm bleeding all blocks, from big Sinus Devilles
Champagne on chill, and I'm full of that kill
And you looking so real, when you touch your heals
Got my nature rising, and I ain't disguising
I think that you are the trophy, and I'm going for the Heisman
So chat with D-Reck, so that we could get wet
We could speed in my jacuzzi, and a drop top Vet
We could jump in a sack, see how fast we connect
I'm at the front I'm at the back, it's like this it's like that what

(Nutty Black)
Bu-bu-buda ? Wreckshop everytime
We rocking it's hot, oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah uh, Wreckshop baby and we won't stop

[Sean Pymp]
Shake it now shake it, now shake it
Shake it, till you break it
Shake it now shake it, see baby
Ain't no need to fake it
Shake it now shake it, now shake it
Shake it, till you break it
Shake it now shake it, see baby
Ain't no need to fake it
Rock it and shock it, don't stop it
Let me see you pop it
Rock it and shock it, don't stop it
Let me see you pop it
Rock it and shock it, don't stop it
Let me see you pop it
Shake on, shake on, shake on, shake on

[Ronnie Spencer]
Shake, shake it baby
Shake, shake it mama
Shake, shake it baby
Shake, shake it mama
Shake it to the East, shake it to the West
Shake it to the North, shake it to the South
Shake it to the East, shake it to the West
Shake it to the North, shake it to the South

[Noke D]
