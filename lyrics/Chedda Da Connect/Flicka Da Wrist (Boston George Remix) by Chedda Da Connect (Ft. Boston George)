[Intro: Chedda Da Connect]
Look at the flicka da wrist

[Hook: Chedda Da Connect]
Catchin' plays, catchin' play
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the wrist

[Verse 1: Chedda Da Connect]
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Some niggas in my sleep tried to capture me
Some bitches in my section tryna fuck for free
Catch a play on these niggas, touchdown
I'm my own quarterback, put my team on
Luxury, that's all I see
Look at the flicka da wrist, got 'em on me
I don't see niggas, I don't see niggas
California loud, got me lit, nigga
I'm the shit, nigga, take your bitch, nigga
You better duck, fool, or you'll get hit, nigga

[Hook: Chedda Da Connect]
Catchin' plays, catchin' play
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist

[Verse 2: Boston George]
I got a bad bitch, seem like she ready
Hit her with that fork, now she screamin' and she yellin'
Walkin' wet willies in a fresh pair of Giuseppes
(Nigga I'm spillin' this sauce) Yeah, fresh pair of Giuseppes
Watch a nigga trip, choppa make a nigga flip
Bitches on a nigga, boy you swear I was a pimp
Red on the bottom of my kicks, I'm flickin' my wrist
I'm flippin' my bitch like a brick, nigga, drip, drip
I'm catchin' plays, chillin' with my youngins
I'm on 10 with 'bout 10, butterflies in my stomach
I rock [?], rock a Rollie, all my jewelry cost a hundred
Blow a nigga's brains off now he a dummy

[Hook: Chedda Da Connect]
Catchin' plays, catchin' play
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
That wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
