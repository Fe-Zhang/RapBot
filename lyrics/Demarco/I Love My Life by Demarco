Or go join the morgue

Never make nobody get di best of you
Look pon di person inna di mirror, pon di dresser too
Tell yourself say, "you nah go make dem pressure you"
And live life to di fullest, that you better do
Just believe me, mi know life nuh easy
Nuff of we never born with gold spoon fi feed we
Nuh be greedy, set a pace inna life and achieve it
Listen to mi keenly
Mi love mi L.I.F.E until it lef' me
Mi a gwan keep happy and pray to Father God say, old age catch me
Me a beg you Father, bless me
Guide and protect me
Fi every wrong move weh mi make inna the streets, correct me, yeah

So me ago live my life today
Me ago live my life today
So everybody help me sing it out
