William, Mommy loves you and I'm so proud of you, but I just wanna remind you, eat all your vegetables

Oooooooohhhh It's Aha, oooohhh yeeaaaah

[Chorus]
I'm feeling supreme, whats that even mean
Its means its disrespectful for you just to call me clean
Its means Im really bout that action like a movie scene
Can't crop me out the picture no no I need everything
Im feeling supreme, Im feeling supreme
They ask too many questions like Aha what does it mean
It means its disrespectful for you just to call me clean
It means that I don't chase nobody only chase my dreams

[Verse 1]
Im feeling supreme, dare to disagree
I told em I ain't smoking steam just coming off of me
I hear they have a problem with me let me intervene
You didn't have a problem when I did all for free
Been cooking for a minute so I guess its time to eat
The pizza got a lotta sauce with extra meat and cheese
You must ain't heard me right I said I ordered that supreme
So don't forget my veggies cause you know I need my green

[Chorus]
I'm feeling supreme, whats that even mean
Its means its disrespectful for you just to call me clean
Its means Im really bout that action like a movie scene
Can't crop me out the picture no no I need everything
Im feeling supreme, Im feeling supreme
They ask too many questions like Aha what does it mean
It means its disrespectful for you just to call me clean
It means that I don't chase nobody only chase my dreams

[Verse 2]
Im feeling supreme, I know they mad at me
They told me not to mention God or say that I believe
They placing limitations tryna tell me what to be
They must forgot I'm from the same place as Master P
The way I draw the play up it looks like a masterpiece
I told her save the date cause Ima take her out to eat
Im just a Burger King thats looking for a Dairy Queen
She said she don't do rappers so I had to go and sing
Im feeling supreme yeah yeah yeah yeah
They like what does it mean yeah yeah yeah yeaaaaah
It means Im on a new level
It means a brand new gold medal
It means that you don't have to settle
I know that you can do better

[Chorus]
Im feeling supreme, Im feeling supreme
They ask too many questions like Aha what does it mean
It means its disrespectful for you just to call me clean
It means that I don't chase nobody only chase my dreams

[Verse 3]
Yea Yea, Aha feels so underrated, new 2k player just created
Misbehave and miss the wave and have the nerve to come say happy belated
This neophyte gon' hit the matrix, I can't be beat better check the cadence
They only wanna fight me to raise the ratings, I'm just gonna ball like a rutabaga
Listen up this my demonstration, I keep my word cause my pens amazing
I hope you can recognize the imitations, I beat up her man again cause he was faking
I be in the field tryna reap this harvest gotta get this corn my fritos ain't lazy
Forget the leaves and get a suit, If it was up to the church Adam would have had on Stacy's
Just keep looking at me like Im crazy, you not in my crew so no ahoy matey
If everybody tree supposed to bear fruit, well ironically some of y'all may not be shady
Honestly really Im just tryna grow, so I understand that some clouds are rainy
Tryna multiply what I have in store so I guess Im a product of those who made me
Everything before was an appetizer, in my room playing chords on my synthesizer
All I need in this world of sin is the blood of Jesus and some sanitizer
Forget the ones Im tryna please, Im only good at being me
I feel like 82' Mike when he dropped Billie Jean
Awww man man how you feel, I feel supreme
