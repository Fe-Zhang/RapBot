[Intro: Aha Gazelle]
It's Aha man
Um, listen this right here is Ruff and Welch fault
Blame them
You know what, matter fact, blame Fiji
He made me do this
It's his fault
(It's Aha!)

[Chorus 1: Aha Gazelle]
Live from my momma house
Where I ain't got no bills, so my pockets never drought
Where every day is sunny, I ain't never seen a cloud
I learned from all of my mistakes just like a female cow
You still ain't got your own place, so why are you so proud?
Good for you, you graduated, what you doing now?
I'm a rapper, here's my mixtape, I'm the man
A whole lot of question marks like they don't understand
Nick Young face

[Verse 1: Aha Gazelle]
Don't believe in me
That's why they hate their life on Monday
I believe in Jesus, you can play this on a Sunday
Then they come back running
Like, "I knew you would be somethin'
Been a long time comin'"
With they hotdog bun face
Everyday I prayed that God will send me a Beyoncé
Everyday I ask Him to protect me from the crime rate
Everyday I ask Him for forgiveness
'Cause He coming back to get us
I don't know all the specifics, that's a blind date
Humble as can be but I still walk around like Kanye
Pull up bumpin' Webbie, then I leave bumpin' Sadé
I got common sense, but I ain't got no sense of time
Man, it's all up in your mind I treat everyday like Friday
Woo!

[Chorus 2: Aha Gazelle]
Live from my momma house
Where I ain't got no bills, so my pockets never drought
Where every day is sunny, I ain't never seen a cloud
I learned from all of my mistakes just like a female cow
You still ain't got your own place, so why are you so proud?
Good for you, you graduated, what you doin' now?
Uh, I'm a rapper, here's my mixtape, check me out
Back then they didn't want me, now they love me now

[Verse 2: Aha Gazelle]
Mike Jones on 'em
Get ignant and start flexin' and pull and up on the chrome on 'em
Don't you think for one second I won't go Victor Stone on 'em
Thought they had me figured out like
"Yeah, I know what he's about"
But then I dropped Vegeta
Yeah, I started singin' songs on 'em
Since they made me wait I had no choice but to get tone on 'em
Hand behind my head, I'm flexin'
Yeah, I Karl Malone on 'em
From New Orleans I'm a no limit Soulja Boy
Tryna kiss me through the phone
Uh-uh, uh-uh, that's the wrong number

[Bridge: Aha Gazelle]
Live from my momma house (uh-oh)
Where I ain't got no bills, so my pockets never drought (uh-oh)
Where every day is sunny, I ain't never seen a cloud (uh-oh)
I'm from Lousiana so I had to make it bounce
(Fiji made me do it)

[Verse 3: MC Fiji]
I'm live from my momma house, look right now
I'm in the kitchen cookin' up somethin' right now
Fiji made me do it, so I did it right now
Aha on the beat, so you know I got it right now
I gotta do it for my momma, get her out the drama
Every time I hit my knees I'm prayin' for some extra commas
I'm sick of tired of bein' sick and tired
My life a movie, but it's never bein' televised
They like, "Fiji don't you do that
You gotta get the bag and don't you look back
You would be in the club throwin' 'em blue stacks"
Everybody in the club askin' who's that? Who's that?
You gotta do it for your momma, do it for your momma
Yeah, I did it for my momma, did it for my momma
You gotta do it for your momma, do it for your momma
Aha do it for your momma, do it for your momma

[Verse 4: Aha Gazelle]
Man, I got a passion for passin' assists
So we you start travellin' the referees gonna panic
'Cause they can't call a mechanic
They tryna take us for granted
They didn't know that we planned it
They must of thought it was random
That execution we ran it
And now they call us satanic
Because they can't understand it
They wanna know how we manage
They more confused than a tranny
I pull up with all my titans
And then we started attackin'
They tried to white us out
We blacker than a famous Jet Jackson
They be like "Aha, what you really 'bout?"
I be like, "You don't really care if you don't know by now"
Everything is funny 'til I pull a Robin Williams
All of y'all gon' miss me
I'ma keep spittin' fire for those who doubt
Don't act like you love me now

[Chorus 1: Aha Gazelle]
Live from my momma house
Where I ain't got no bills, so my pockets never drought
Where every day is sunny, I ain't never seen a cloud
I learned from all of my mistakes just like a female cow
You still ain't got your own place, so why is you so proud?
Good for you, you graduated, what you doin' now?
Uh, I'm a rapper, here's my mixtape, I'm the man
A whole lot of question marks like they don't understand
Nick Young face

[Break: MC Fiji]
Woo, man we live in my momma house right now!
Oh my God, my momma gon' put us out man
Aha chill!
Know what, bring it back Aha
One more time

[Outro: MC Fiji]
Yeah, yeah
You gotta do it for ya, you gotta do it for ya
You gotta do it for ya momma, uh-huh, uh
You better do it for ya momma uh-huh, uh
I said we live baby, I said we live baby
I said we live baby, I said we live baby
Cut this off man, I'm out
