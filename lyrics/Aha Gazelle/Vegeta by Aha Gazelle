[Hook]
Don't be fooled; I'm nothing special
I know you can do better
I don't have it together
You'll wish you never met me
I promise you'll regret it
With me there's no forever
I'll push you out the window
Don't fall for my potential

[Verse 1]
I don't care bout ya feelings
Get back-- just mind ya business
Got so much work to do
I'm tryna blow up the building
Don't question my decisions
Didn't ask for your opinion
It's me and all my crew
We turnt up through the ceiling
Where the bass at? I dont feel it
They watching and they filming
I'm so concerned with winning
I forget I'm supposed to witness
I do believe in God
And, Jesus died for me
It's my favorite excuse
When I let sin succeed

[Hook]
Don't be fooled; I'm nothing special
I know you can do better
I don't have it together
You'll wish you never met me
I promise you'll regret it
With me there's no forever
I'll push you out the window
Don't fall for my potential
Oh, no, no, no, no
Get everything you own
And go, go, go, go
I told you once before
Don't act like you don't knoooo-ooo-ooo-oow
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea

[Verse 2]
I don't care bout ya feelings
I told you mind ya business
I told you I'm a rapper
Y'all want a politician
Because I tell the truth
Y'all tryna take my position
I'm just too real for you
I have no secret missions
We turnt up through the ceiling
Why you come in here with all this fighting
Mess with us and they gon' feel it
Josh said he has license
And you know what that means...we sorry...

[Hook]
Don't be fooled; I'm nothing special
I know you can do better
I don't have it together
You'll wish you never met me
I promise you'll regret it
With me there's no forever
I'll push you out the window
Don't fall for my potential
Oh, no, no, no, no
Get everything you own
And, go, go, go, go

[Verse 3]
I told you once before
And you know what that means
I need you to get away get away from here
I need you to take everything that you have
Get as far as you can baby
Don't look back at me
Don't let me waste your time
Get your stuff and leave
It's not fair for you to have to wait for me
Here's your heart-- take it back; don't forget your keys
And, it's raining outside so please do not speed
So, just drive away
And, remember everything that I tried to say
Delete that heart by my name; not even a smiley face

[Hook]
Don't be fooled; I'm nothing special
I know you can do better
I don't have it together
You'll wish you never met me
I promise you'll regret it
With me there's no forever

[Outro]
Anointing fall on me
Anointing fall on me
Let the power of the Holy Ghost fall on me
Anointing fall on me
Yeaaaaa
On me, on me
Yeaaaaa, cool
That's that sauce
