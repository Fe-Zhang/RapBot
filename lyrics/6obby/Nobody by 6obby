[Intro]
Ka-Ka-Kamikaze

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody really fuckin' with me like they always say
And all these people hit me up but I know that they be fake
Gonna grab the lawn mower and finally cut off all you snakes
I just wanna one day finally get up out this place
But that's always been the dream, same shit, a different day
So I pop a few Xan's and try to eliminate this pain
But it's never gonna change and I'll always feel the same
I'on know what to do, my life is lookin' plain
Never feel excited and it's always been this way
I wanna make it out, I wanna get up out this rain
You say you had my back but always saw me in this pain
I'm tired of this shit and I'm so tired of these days
Sleepless nights, anxiety just ain't no good for me
Wanna tell my problems but nobody listening
Sleepless nights, anxiety just ain't no good for me
Wanna tell my problems but nobody listening, yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody listening, yeah
Ain't nobody listening, yeah
Ain't nobody listening, yeah
Ain't nobody fucking care
Ain't nobody fucking care, yeah
Ain't nobody fucking care, yeah
Ain't nobody fucking care, yeah

[Verse 2]
So I smoke up all this dope and I always check my phone
Every five minutes, even though that I'm alone
Nobody hit me up, I'm always feelin' like a ghost
I just wanna find some peace but nowhere feels like home
Always smokin' up and sippin' on some styrofoam
Yeah, I got this guap and that iPhone rose gold
But that don't mean I'm happy, I'm just feeling so alone
I just want somebody who would listen and can cope
I'on know what to do 'cause I can't trust a soul
Sippin' all this lean but still, these problems overflow
I ain't got shit to lose like I'm on death row
Say you understand but you don't even fuckin' know
Every day I wake up and I'm always feelin' low
I just chase this dream and hope that one day I will blow
I've just had enough and hope that one day this can stop
I'll just keep on working and grinding to the top, yeah
