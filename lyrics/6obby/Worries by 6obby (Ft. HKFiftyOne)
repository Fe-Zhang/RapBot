[Intro: HKFiftyOne]
Ayy, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: HKFiftyOne]
I just spent five-hunnid on a Fendi, ayy
I'm on my way up, you know that I'm trendin', ayy
You don't know 'bout all this guap I'm spendin', ayy
I make real stacks but all y'all just pretendin', ayy
I stay up late, you know I'm thinkin' 'bout this shit
I'm movin' up and you know that I rock this bitch
Ralph Lauren my Polo, just the tip of it
Spendin' money, I still can't find happiness
Don't know anymore, life's a metaphor, hit the floor
I can't handle more, stop me now before I break the door
I stay up all night, party, I just might catch a flight
You don't really know, I'm not scared to die, nah
Feel like giving up, raise this fuckin' cup, drink it up
You know I'm fed up, always chasin' love, don't give a fuck
You know how I flex on a shawty, right?
Want a goth girl sippin' syrup in the moonlight, yeah

[Verse 2: 6obby]
And I told that bitch, "I’m done wit' ya
After all those lies and worries, I’m just done wit' ya"
Drinking all my worries away in the double cup
I been steady flexin', had to get my bands up
Yeah, I’m smokin' green, drinkin' on this lean, I’m chasin' dreams
In that vintage Polo Ralph, just looking so clean
See me chasin' paper and I do it with my fuckin' team
People keep on talkin' but it really don’t mean shit to me
Thinkin' 'bout my life, I been on my grind all this time
I been flexin', yeah, but sometimes I just wanna die
Asking what is wrong, and most times I just can’t reply
I just can't reply, smokin' blunts until my brain is fried
I just don’t know why you look me in the eyes and then you lie
I’m just fuckin' done in my mind, I’m still on the run
Fuck it, we just livin' for the moment so just live it up
See me in the black and you know I’m sippin' two cups
Dead with no heart, yeah, I’m dead with no soul
I'm so fuckin' lost and I don’t even know where to go
I been steady getting guap and I do it on the low
Rollin' up a Backwood and I roll that shit slow
Watch me spark this fucking ganja, grab a lighter, watch it glow
I been gettin' guap, designer from the head to the toe
All of you pretendin' but yeah, I got hella dough
Start to feel wavy, I been poppin' hella hydros
