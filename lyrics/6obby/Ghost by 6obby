[Verse 1]
Smokin' that dope but I can’t cope
Feelin' depressed and I’m feelin' alone
Checkin' my phone, I’m just a ghost
They all backstabbed me and left me alone
I ain’t got friends, no one can cope
Living my life 'til the end of the road
Bud is so green that it look like a toad
Feelin' depressed, I’m on my own
Smokin' a blunt, I’m in my zone
Louis my belt, Gucci cologne
All of these rappers they sound like some clones
Fuck what you say, take my own way
Smokin' a blunt straight to the face
Smokin' a blunt straight to the face
Fuck what you say, I don’t chill with no fakes
Fuck what you say, I don’t chill with no fakes, nah

[Chorus]
I need to get a map 'cause I cannot find my mind
Always smokin' up in circles and I do it all the time
Feel this sadness every night, I just wanna be alright
I spark the blunt and then ignite
I take a shot and then take flight, yeah
I need to get a map 'cause I cannot find my mind
Always smokin' up in circles and I do it all the time
Feel this sadness every night, I just wanna be alright
I spark the blunt and then ignite
I take a shot and then take flight, yeah

[Verse 2]
Smokin' so much to the point I can’t think
Stress on my mind, Polo horse on my waist
Tommy my cap, dope in my blunt
Ounce in my trunk, tar in my lungs
Fuck all the ones who be talkin', they full of it
Steady just callin', I’m askin' like, "Who it is?"
Lovin' me now but was hating me then
Don’t call up my number, don’t call me your friend, nah
I be smokin' marijuana 'til I fuckin' pass out
I be mixin' up the Henny, mix it with the Crown
I just wanna be happy but I hate this town
I can’t even keep a smile or a friend around, nah
