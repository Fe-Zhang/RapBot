[Verse 1: SVRITE]
Tommy Hilfiger my coat, chain on my neck and it hang like a rope, yeah
I just be hittin' the road, road to a milli, now I feel like the GOAT, yeah
Roamin' the world like a ghost, walk in the city with nowhere to go, yeah
But I just stuck with my hope, I found the one and my heart never broke
Told her, "Come and find me, all the pain inside me"
Told her, "Please don't mind me, there's no other like me" (Nah)
Told her, "Come and find me, all the pain inside me"
Told her, "Please don't mind me, there's no other like me" (Nah)
Tú eres lo que yo quiero, todo el mundo completo
Yo quería algo nuevo, y ahora ya te tengo
Y tú eres mi princesa, todo lo que te merezcas
Yo quiero tenerte cerca, eres bella y honesta

[Refrain: SVRITE]
Look, come fuck wit' a nigga like me, I'll hold you down (Ah yeah, ah yeah)

The treasure and the beauty that I found (Yeah)
With you, baby, I'm staying ten toes down (Yeah)
Come fuck wit' a nigga like me, I'll hold you down (I'll hold you down)

I'm not like the other ones (Yeah)
Your beauty shines just like the sun (Like the sun, girl)

[Verse 2: 6obby]
Vintage from head to my toes, yeah, I got friends, but I still feel alone, yeah
Sauce in the whip, it's a ghost, ballin' so hard like my name is D. Rose, yeah
I just be counting these checks, wantin' the gold and the ice on my neck, yeah
Shawty, don't leave me upset, breakin' my heart like she left me for dead, yeah
Shawty, I am sick of feeling numb, yeah
I just wanna make you number one, yeah
We can take it slow because we're young, yeah
Wanna take you shoppin' and to lunch, yeah

[Outro: 6obby]
Baby girl, it's so simple, double G's in the symbols
If you ever left me, baby, just know I would go mental
Baby girl, it's so simple, double G's in the symbols
If you ever left me, baby, just know I would go mental, yeah
