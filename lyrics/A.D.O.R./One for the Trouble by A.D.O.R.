[Intro]

[Verse 1: A.D.O.R]

Back once again with the ill behaviour, can you feel it?
Nothing can save ya'
It's the A for ally, D for damager
O for out of here, R for the renegade master
Of all I survey
Checkin' straight out the slum, so no roads to portray
Just sexual, exceptional
And to let you know, that my flow is like, dope
I got a mad mad style of frustration
Just another product of the anger in the nation
Now I get paid for my jazzy sensation
And I drop bombs, for my generation
Peace to the crews from New York to LA
Power to the people that struggle everyday
The east coast [?] is where I stay
When I had no loot, I used to cool around my way
Call up [?] Brooklyn will, and big K
I boned a lot of girls, getting high on alize
Feelin' drunk, gettin' them fly fat ass thick babies
Cause I got the hits boomin' out the trunk
Ain't' it strange, how things change
When they take you out the ground, and put you in the fast lane
But I never knew the shiny happy home, so I'll do just fine rollin' through my terror dome

[Chorus: A.D.O.R]

One for the trouble
Two for hard time
One for the trouble
Two for hard time
One for the trouble
Two for hard time
People get ready, it's time for the child to shine



[Verse 2: A.D.O.R]
So rata-tat-tata, my mental gets phatter
Best protect ya neck, 'fore you climb Jacobs ladder
Cause I raise hell, a lot of MC's fell
But I won't fall, cause I walk tall
Rockin' on the mic, I only rock for real
'cause I really don't know about the mass appeal
Don't try to be cutesy, you can keep a suit
Still clockin' loot, staying true to the root
Lovin' all my honeys that's wild feelin' rugged
With thick strong hands, so when I'm strokin' I can tug it
So come on baby, let me drive you crazy
I get em all hot when I press up on the daisy
Cause they love the child that gets buck wild
With the new style

(One)
(two)
(One)
(two)

[Chorus: A.D.O.R]

One for the trouble
Two for hard time
One for the trouble
Two for hard time
One for the trouble
Two for hard time
People get ready, it's time for the child to shine

[Verse 3: A.D.O.R]
See I rock it as a rap star
They used to say
It's one in a million that you might get far
See you got a different face, of the cream shade of race
But it just don't matter, cause I rock the whole place
From the front to the back I get love for the track
Yes yes y'all, it's like that
Like if you're whack, you're whack
And if you hit you live phat
And if you wanna get wild, you might die by the gat
Just kickin' facts black, so please step back
Group home style, [?] with the track
He's the creator, I'm the motivator
Never played the back, so I'm not the spectator
Stressin I'm confessin, every day I learn a lesson
But I'm still breathin', god, that's my blessing
So one for the trouble, revolution kind
Let's get it on, let me blow your mind

[Chorus: A.D.O.R]

One for the trouble
Two for hard time
One for the trouble
Two for hard time
One for the trouble
Two for hard time
People get ready, it's time for the child to shine
