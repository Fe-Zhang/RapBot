She's beautiful...she's beautiful...

This girl I know, she makes me see
The poetry within her being
Beauty takes a hold of me
And washes out the shallow things
This girl I know, she's all I need
To make me free of painful dreams
I take the day to hold her hand
And show her that she's part of me

Open me up and just take what you need
I'm nothing without the concept of defeat
Eatin' the apple off, plantin' the seed
For the day that we came to "we"-type of a need

So do what you want with the collet you wear
Know that you can't be gottin' to compare
That anyone else in this world, no way
Give their love as a game, but I'm down to play

Just wanted to make you laugh and hope
Takin' you out with a passionate poem
You be the kind of a girl that I'm breakin' it
Waitin' the moment then takin' her home

Just wanted to let you and know that I care
Got enough love for the feelin' impared
You be the reason to secretly
Keepin' me up in the morning to fight for what's fair

I'm gonna hold you, protect
Like a shell around your pain
I wanna show you respect
And help you face the next day

So take what you need of me,feed of my dream
You in my life is about all I need
Writin' the line and then makin' the beat
For the reason I live and the reason I sleep

You, be the most perfect creation... you, takin' me out of depression
You, makin' me feel like a man that can take you and lead you to love by the hand

This girl I know, she makes me see
The poetry within her being
Beauty takes a hold of me
And washes out the shallow things
This girl I know, she's all I need
To make me free of painful dreams
I take the day to hold her hand
And show her that she's part of me

This girl I know, she makes me see
The poetry within her being
Beauty takes a hold of me
And washes out the shallow things
This girl I know, she's all I need
To make me free of painful dreams
I take the day to hold her hand
And show her that she's part of me

This girl I know, she makes me see
The poetry within her being
Beauty takes a hold of me
And washes out the shallow things
This girl I know, she's all I need
To make me free of painful dreams
I take the day to hold her hand
And show her that she's part of me
