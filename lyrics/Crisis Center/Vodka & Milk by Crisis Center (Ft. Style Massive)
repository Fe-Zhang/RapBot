[Undefined Christ of Rhyme]
(Version 2.0, we're back..)
Yo, it's the C-C-dot-P,Got it lock-D
Crisis Center program, we the top three
Burn end to end ain't nothin' gonna stop me
No one make a move, y'all cats could never block me
Hold down the fort, or maybe they forgot me
Once we set it off guaranteed they gonna watch me
Flow head to head ain't nothin' gonna stop me
No one make a move, y'all cats could never block me

Yo, catch me in the lobby, still lacin' vicious
Next level shit, upgrade your system
Basement to backyard, backyard to kitchen
Blue hoody up, Crisis Center across the stitchin'
Christ shine on mics, kid you can't miss it
Spit game as nice, and it's like "you can't switch it"
Street corner anthem, stuck off the realness
Crisis Center Pro., y'all know just how we did this
Elevated flow, extraordinary fitness
On to some next shit, y'all could tell the difference
1-900-CRISIS swerve through your district
Spit heat at crowds 'til they look like burn victims
Whoever talkin' stick 'em (stick 'em) who above us?
Cat's wanna pop shit, (nah) but they duck us
Same Vanilla Sky smokin' chocolate dutches
Crisis Center's here, bad news for motherfucker's..Trust me

[Style Massive]
(Style Mass!) I don't come with those weak rhymes
Represent corners like fuckin' street signs
Move more +Z's+ than Nissan
Testing the Center? Ain't got a chance
You ain't a man, I could smell the pussy under your pants
(Mass!) Got it locked like vice-grips
Crack more backs than fuckin' knight-sticks
Stay on point like ice-picks (Yeah)
Yo, who the nicest? It's the Crisis
Impossible to sell-out when the shit you spit is priceless
Throw your fist up and pull the dro out
Ill as Ben Wallace when he lets the fro out (c'mon)
Dog it ain't a game, it's a blow out
Knot so thick I catch a pump when I pull the dough out
Same old story, your bullshit flow bore me
My name catch respect in the game like Joe Torre
Guts not glory, so I aim for your face
And throw bullets at your legs, help you stay in your place (C-C-dot-P)
