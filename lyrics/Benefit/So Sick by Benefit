[Bert] I'm sick!
[Ernie] What's the matter, Bert?
[Bert] I'm sick!
[Ernie] Oh yeah?
[Bert] I'm sick, Ernie! Can't you tell that?
[Ernie] You're sick?
[Bert] I'm sick!
[Ernie] You're sick?
[Bert] I'm sick!
[Ernie] Then you caught it!
[Ernie] Boy, you must know who it is who's sick!

[Verse 1]
As my verse disperses the worst curses
A person hurts worse than
The first virgin's privacy-purse burstin'
I walk around the underground as a powerful thundersound
Wearin' the low-down, profound, lyrical wonder crown
Advanced listenin' wrestlin' with pressure expressions
And steppin' in as a special specimen fresher than freshman
Obvious overdosage coasted it over oceans
With explosive posters flyer than your promotional posters
Skillfully killin', willfully drillin' syllable spillin'
Feelin' really upsettable, bitin' is edible stealin'
Walkin' around the planet, rockin' the ground like granite
Cockin' my sound cannon and stoppin' the sound famine
Deliberate inconsiderate etiquette, Benefit's belligerence
Spittin' shit like laxative excrement
Dove in a frozen ocean, fell low below boastin'
The one chosen who rose, exposin' the flow erosion

[Hook]
So nice that it's nasty, so bangin' it's bustin'
So sweet that it's sick, so dope it's disgustin'
So nice that it's nasty, so bangin' it's bustin'
So sweet that it's sick, so dope it's disgustin'

[Verse 2]
I lead an expedition in vision and competition
In a prison when deliverin' witherin' rhyme litterin'
Givin' and never endeavorin' ever, clever however
Bringin' it whether together or on solo feathers
Sicker than liquor and medicine burnin' and blisterin'
Leave your lights flickerin'
Quicker than strobes you're trippin' in
The high-appointed, style anointed with ill delivery ointment
On point with this like jointed presidential appointments
Flashin' full fashionable, rational, lyrical passion
Glow-bashin' skulls, burnin' trash flows and watch ash grow
Belittlin' with little men livin' in oblivion
Try battlin', imaginin' that they're hyper than Ritalin
Simply deranged brain exchanged pain for gain
Rearrange your frame to strange plain pattern when slain
Bigger, badder and better than all of your gold and cheddar
When spreadin' wing like medicine
Men with ancient tribal letterin'

[Hook]
So nice that it's nasty, so bangin' it's bustin'
So sweet that it's sick, so dope it's disgustin'
So nice that it's nasty, so bangin' it's bustin'
So sweet that it's sick, so dope it's disgustin'

[Ben] Sick, sick, so sick.
[Bert] I'm sick, sick, sick!
[Ben] Sick, sick, so sick.
