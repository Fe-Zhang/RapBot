[Hook]
(Boom, Boom!)
When we pull up to the club it go (Boom, Boom!)
When we rolling down the block it go (Boom, Boom!)
If I take it out my belt it go (Boom, Boom!)

[Verse 1]
We in a drop top way too gully
Flat brim fitted, west coast skullies
Other fools try to roll up, but you know what
Show the toast marks slow up
Hold up - What's really hood
Sitting in a scraper with the TV in the wood
It's going down like I said that it would
Hydro's bounce like a hydro should
All the doors open, wheels still smokin
Dancin on the roof; grinning, but I ain't jokin
In the intersection with the tints blacked up
Sounds jacked up, traffic backed up
We stay macked up, bangin like what
Throwin up sets, leave 'em hangin' like what
We like the legion of doom
Leaning to the side while the track goes boom

[Hook]
