[Hook: Christian Riley and Anacron]
Whatcha gonna do when the music
Whatcha gonna do when the beats
Whatcha gonna do when the sound of the streets stop bringing in the bread and the meat
When you're singing and the check don't mix
When your lips ain't pulling out the hits
When your LP sales ain't doing hot
Whatcha gonna do when the music stops...

[Verse 1: Anacron]
(Now whatcha gonna do)
Everybody needs something to fall back on
A skill to call back on
The days the sun don't shine and rain drops fine
What you want tracks on, and pitter pat on your future
The time to lean or the talent you sat on
For so long, hope it's not gone
With the money and the entourage and groupies
The fame and the mags and the goofy outfits
Yeah you was the shit, when your first plate when plat
Whatcha gonna do when the label
Whatcha gonna do when the fans
Whatcha gonna do when the world in your hands cracks beneath your iron grip
When your mansion goes to the highest bid
When your woman mash out with your kids
And your boys that you thought was true was not
Whatcha gonna do, when the music stop...


[Hook]
Whatcha gonna do when the music

When your lips ain't pulling out the hits
When your LP sales ain't doing hot
Whatcha gonna do when the music stops...

I swear everybody got lyrics, no lie
Fools rhyme and they don't know why
Real emcee's are performers that freeze in more ways than one
To seize a crowd is an ability learned from none
Why achieve the ends through only one means
I mean that you don't hunt without an extra clip for your gun
Have fun, explore your talents
Don't lose your balance and fall off
The day that the contracts called off
Or when that independent ain't hauled off
Rights of distributor hitting your pocket with a tape
You gotta give respect, that's real
How you gonna tell em how you feel
When they not checking for your analog reels
When you're not second on the station's playlist
Hey this factual, there's actually many that fell prey to same way
Thinking their career would last forever and a day
You fit into the mold just like clay
But even Playdough gets hard and can't change over time, then it gets thrown away
I respect those that utilize skill, the true to life real, doing life still
Running businesses, opening shops
Painting images of toatting them crops
Write poetry and preform spoken word
Options limitless because they didn't stop
When they were ahead, just like me
Imma stay fed no matter what I be
I invested hella time building, skills that could come in handy
So whether I'm rapping or not I'll be damned if my life ain't fine and dandy
Thanks to the words of my fluent Pops, Imma be straight
When the music stops...
