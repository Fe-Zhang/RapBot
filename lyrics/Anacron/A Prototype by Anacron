[Verse]
It’s The Garden Family Circle and Anacron
‘finna leave your blood curdled. The man is on
Like an RC made by Ertl. Don’t stand for long
'cause I hop, skip, and hurdle with damn-a'strong
Westernized Olympic verbals. I ran the bomb
Right from one end of the Earth 'til the Amazon
Fck that sticky-icky-purple, and damn a bomb
This is poppin’ like a Burple retract to long
Nggas try to rap and gurgle — I’ll slam a Don
If he’s tugging at my shirt ‘til my grammar spawns
Earfuls of profane curse bull, so can the brawn
Unless you want to get some hurtful. I’ll scan your jawn
With a look that’s making her feel a panty pond
Between her legs, mushy like Urkel. I’ll cram the wand
In her crack like a gerbil, no pantalons!
Anacron’s a walking Herschel. From Grand to John
Kennedy Airport the turf we’ll be standing on
We’ll be blazing like fresh herbals. Man the song
Will keep poppin’ like a kernel, and slamming on
Daily just like a diurnal . A jammer gone
Nuts, like that fool Studs Terkel. I’ll ban a pawn
For rapping slower than a turtle. I am the darn
Cutest thing you’ve seen like Nermal — It’s Anacron
Underground never commercial!
