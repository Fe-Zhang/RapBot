[Hook]
Nightly, slightly, unsightly
Roll tightly with the homies uprightly
Uptight me? Nah, I dip lightly
Through the spot quite politely

[Verse 1]
I light dark avenues with a bright smile
A night owl, with a night lifestyle on the prowl
Shrouded in the same cowl worn by the Dodgers
I be up in What's Happening!! like Roger
DeWayne and Rerun
Sliding in long after the set done begun
Hella fools front like they know me from the next face in the club
House music subs all around while I scope for a female to plug
Hey baby, get connected, it will be electrifying
When you're lying on your back with my face between your thighs
And my hands on your tits, I'm the man up in this
Take a look around the club, from where I stand it's the shit
I'm down to hang until six cause I just woke up at five O'clock
So I'm wide awake and live to rock the mic with hot fiber optic
Transmissions (It's sick man, listen)
Just wait until Jess' throw on some downtempo hip-hop
For now I'm vibing offa Brian Gar'
Snag a juice at the bar then post up like a shining star
Riding hard (What that night life like?)
I be doing it nightly 5-to-5

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(What y'all fools know about 'Cron, though?)
My easy living is the envy of every John Doe
Sam Civilian, and Normal Everyday Patty and Pete
I lounge at the tilt all day making beats
Touching knobs, buttons, and keys, I'm a star fool
When night falls and the moon comes out I do too
Throwing jibs at shammies, chickenheads, hoochies and pigeons
Dancing at the club bridging science and religion
Here's something to believe in, through the crowd weavin'
Even not lopsided, got sighted by the homie
Who slapped my hand, and said "what's up?"
I'm like, " Shit, G's lounge, hoes down, butts up"
In the darkness somewhere sparks split some hair
When niggas start tripping over some bitch doused in Nair
I'll never let a ho be the reason I lose my life
But I'll die for my mom, my sister or my wife
To be. I'm in shades and it's all fine
Cause everybody loves the moonshine
Let me get on this dance floor, this track is hella wicked
Play that beat, play that beat, kick it

[Hook]
