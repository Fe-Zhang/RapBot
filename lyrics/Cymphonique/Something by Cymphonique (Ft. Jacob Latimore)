I know I'm young
But I know what I want
It wasn't hard for me to figure it out
Knew you was something different
When you caught my attention
You really changed me, baby

I wasn't even looking
But then I saw you
You kinda made it hard for me
To pass by you
You came so unexpected, boy
But I'm not complaining
Cause I'm so into you, baby

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
Got my heart skipping a beat
Don't know what's got into me
Every time I'm with you
There is something

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
Got my heart skipping a beat
Always got me hypnotized
Must be something in your eyes
Got me hooked on you
There is something

Never tripping off all these silly girls
Even though they're all chasing you
But I ain't mad at 'em
Look at you, boy
You got everything a girl could want

I wasn't even looking
But then I saw you
You kinda made it hard for me
To pass by you
You came so unexpected, boy
But I'm not complaining
Cause I'm so into you, baby

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
Got my heart skipping a beat
Don't know what's got into me
Every time I'm with you
There is something

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
Got my heart skipping a beat
Always got me hypnotized
Must be something in your eyes
Got me hooked on you
There is something

You're my best friend that I never thought I'd have
There's no question or mistake that's crossing paths
Me and you together are a dream come true
Something about you, boo

So many guys in the world
But ain't none of them like you
No, said there's something bout you
And I hope you feel it too
There's no limit to the way I'm feeling

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
Got my heart skipping a beat
Don't know what's got into me
Everytime I'm with you
There is something

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
Got my heart skipping a beat
Always got me hypnotized
Must be something in your eyes
Got me hooked on you
There is something

Something 'bout you, babe
Something 'bout you, babe
There is something
