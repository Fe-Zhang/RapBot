You're my best friend, my baby
There's no doubts or maybes
You're my best friend, my baby
There's no doubts or maybes

[Chorus x2:]
You give me butterflies
You make me feel like I can fly
You got my head in the clouds
You lift me off the ground
And I don't wanna come down

I can't help but smile when I see you
My heart beats so fast when I'm around you
I can't control what I feel inside (you give me butterflies)
Put me on cloud nine

You're the one that really understands me
I can be who I am (you never try to change me)
Even when it rains and I'm going threw thangs
You're always there and you never complain

[Chorus x2:]
You give me butterflies
You make me feel like I can fly
You got my head in the clouds
You lift me off the ground
And I don't wanna come down

You're my beautiful butterfly
Like a rainbow in the sky
You gave me wings now I can fly
You told me never let life pass you by

Everytime I'm sad you make me laugh

Even when I'm down you lift me up
Even when I cry you make me smile
You turn my bad days all around

[Chorus x2:]
You give me butterflies
You make me feel like I can fly
You got my head in the clouds
You lift me off the ground
And I don't wanna come down

You spread my wings (like a butterfly)
Make me wanna sing (feel like I can fly)
You make me feel (like I'm you're butterfly)
It's just you and me (high up in the sky)

You spread my wings (like a butterfly)
Make me wanna sing (feel like I can fly)
You make me feel (like I'm you're butterfly)
It's just you and me (high up in the sky)

You're my best friend, my baby
There's no doubts or maybes
You're my best friend, my baby
There's no doubts or maybes

[Chorus x2:]
You give me butterflies
You make me feel like I can fly
You got my head in the clouds
You lift me off the ground
And I don't wanna come down
