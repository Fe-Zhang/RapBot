I love the way you talk to me
Swear this is how it’s suppose to be
Love how you keep it real
Love how you make me feel
And that it’s just what it is

See I can’t even lie
I love the way you be lookin at me like dead up in my eyes
Cause that’s the look you give me to let me know that everything alright
Long as you down
I’m holding you down
And that’s what I like
And they don’t even have a clue
The chemistry we share that’s between me and you
And they hating and they mad cause they can’t do what we do
Cause no matter what I’m gon keep it 100 with my boo

Chorus:
I love the way you talk to me
Swear this is how it’s suppose to be
I love the way you talk to me
Swear this is how it’s suppose to be
Love how you keep it real
Love how you make me feel
And that it’s just what it is

I’ma hold it down for you
Cause you my boo
I love the way you talk that
Talk and everything you do
I love the way you dress, oh baby you be fresh
Love everything you do to me cause baby you the best

And now they all on my instagram
Blowing up my phone
Checking on my twiter
They mad cause we on
They all in my grill when I’m thuggin with my boo
Ain’t tryna make em mad on purpose
I’m just doing what I do
Matching rollies with the big faces
Telling time at six different places
Turn up in that spaceship; slow motion matrix
Got that good and they basics, see the hating all in they faces
I like what you say but I love how you say it

I love the way you talk to me
Swear this is how it’s suppose to be
Love how you keep it real
Love how you make me feel
And that it’s just what it is

Bridge:
I’ma hold it down for you
Cause you my boo
I love the way you talk that
Talk and everything you do
I love the way you dress, oh baby you be fresh
Love everything you do to me cause baby you the best

Keep saying what you saying, what you saying what you saying to me baby
B-baby you the best!

I love the way you talk to me
Swear this is how it’s suppose to be
Love how you keep it real
Love how you make me feel
And that it’s just what it is
