(Faye Medina - 2x)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Playa I.K.E.]
Now the glaring sun is in my eyes
Or the sky is crystal clear through Denver skies

[Playa Intenze]
The day a player's specialized
To mac and socialize

[Playa I.K.E.]
As I visualize, glimpsing through my blinds
A couple of brown cutie pies with tender thighs and perfect figure size
Guaranteed to be model material looking nice
And I know I recognize trying to figure out and strategize
A playalistic macking way to alphebatize, the little miss things
Looking and walking these crooked streets
So sweet and petite underneath some blazing 90 degree heat

[Playa Intenze]
Now Intenze and the O walking outside the meeting
For the fifth cause fool we complete
Smoking a blunt, when we greet asking if they get high
Then she passed the hit and did the nod then she winked her eye
While I'm watching her homies rover, just to classify
And every five and wonder what's going down tonight
Rumors say it's suppose to be hella tight

[Playa I.K.E.]
But just to invite individuals acting right for this palyers gathering
That the Faculty of Playaz are handling

[Hook: Faye Medina]
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up
It's time to get up, get up, get up, get up
Check it out, check it out
Prime Playaz stepping out
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up
It's time to get up, get up, get up, get up
Check it out, check it out
Playaz speaking without a doubt

[Playa Intenze]
It's a quarter pass two on adventure to the bar-b-que
Scheming and peeping out the view, I'm slamming a 20 for Corona brew
Lovely ladies lounging in the park with a crew
Now I'm looking to see what's available on the menu
Nothing but beautiful babes and blunts

[Playa I.K.E.]
No hitting punks just a half-a-kit whoile Faculty drunk and
Flock a females shaking that rump on the second day of the month
As I approach and confront where my players dwell
Some of them client tail the rest Faculty personel

[Faye Medina]
Rolling up a blunt, lounging with my crew
Trying to figure out what this cutie's gonna do
Are you rolling with a Prime Playa, tonight

[Playa Intenze]
Now we puffing a blunt up in the spot where all the ladies are at
Are the daisy dukes and shirts shaking that ass
Getting they drink and smoke on having a blast
Cause the players in my Faculty like to mingle
Conversate with females who are single so it's all, legal
Letting them know about the ?

[Hook: Faye Medina]
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up
It's time to get up, get up, get up, get up
Average ladies in our side, all th players cossing mine
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up
It's time to get up, get up, get up, get up
Average ladies in our side, riding candies for the night

[Playa I.K.E.]
With a coule cases of Coronas and the urban aroma
Enhances all the homies to be in a coma as I twist and flip
The corner headed straight, from Kentucky to 38th
Looking to conversate with nothing female bait
While trying to locate the nearest emabsy of state

[Playa Intenze]
Got the hit to let be flow yesterday to make the ladies
And get come say they a little bit better
Notorious Prime, Playaz putting it down in any type of weather
Mobbing up in the hotel party, with a cake and a gallon of bacardi
Looking to the left watching all the ladies dancing naughty

[Playa I.K.E.]
With the swisher sweet pre rolling but a puff for everybody
Lounging in the embasy, tooting sweets property
And cooperatively and from what these ladies are offering me
A player can't cop a plee, they hollering poppi please
Hoping for some late night fondelies but honestly
Let me lounge back where my mobsters be
I'll return to toss the sheets cause curiosity
Having you attracted, any casualty and ordinary player fashioned

[Faye Medina - 2x]
Now that the mood is right, Prime Playaz stepping out tonight
Lounging in the pick up right gaming round the finest around cutie pie
