[Chorus - Poly Seed & Flip]
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots

[Verse1 - Poly Seed]
It's that P O L Y G shit niggas don't understand once again while i bust this
Rhyme for that ass cos my cash be flowing
Stackin up my paper cos my paper keep me going
Knowing how these wanna stick me for my ends
I'm drinking from some hen in a '96 benz
Brake me to some friends on the side that I know

[Verse2 - Flip]
But, umm...
Hoochies come and go when a brothers on show
Really though, from show to show I spit my line
In a matter of time this hoochie money is mine
Looking fine from behind but she all about cash
Tried to break me for my ends but I broke her for that ass

[Chorus - Poly Seed & Flip]
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots

[Verse3 - Poly Seed & Flip)]
Like a sister I'mma get ya outside the open
I see you scoping all my money but my honey got you hoping

Hoping, scoping it's all to the good I can get it like I should
Spend the money like I could check out wood
Break you to the bone later flip will lead you on
Baby physically dementedly shady

Shady ass brother wanna break me told him he can take me
Bake me but player don't you hate me
Just ride with a G

But don't sip with that shit

Just ride with a G

Break that chit for her shit

Player you's a trick serving treats for free
All upon a poly c like a N.U.T
How you be

Flip I be more bomb than candy
Looking good and dandy
Keep these hoes in handy
Understand me I'm all about flocking my grip
Don't even trip when I hit
Up that dough when I could



[Chorus - Poly Seed & Flip)]
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots

[Verse4 - Poly & Flip)]
It don't amaze me don't even phase me
Trying to get me for my knots

You think he's crazy

Hell yeah, for sure
I think it's time to know
My money is my main man so you have got to go

Now you players play attention listen as I mention
Ladies now our days be coming up with new inventions

My intentions to step right into your little game
Ain't no thing got that hen got that money that you want

Girl you lame talking shit about your hair and nails
Living fairy tails spinning dollar bills
I swear you on that smoke cos you joking yourself
And trippin when you trickers [?]

[Chorus - Poly Seed & Flip)]
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These players in my pocket trying to get me for my knots
I got money, money I got
These hoochies in my pocket trying to get me for my knots

Break it down...

Yeah, money I got
Yeah, money I got
I got money money I got
I got money money I got

I dedicate this one to my homeboy Rass Cazz
