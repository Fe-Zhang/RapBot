Chorus:

Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight


Verse 1:
This is just for you
My kitty boo boo
I'm thinking about the things me and you went through
It's just the main fact you never turned your back
You kept your love strong and showed no ?
I don't think no one can your place
I know if they tried ? to the face
Although you and I sometimes fuss and fight
I know it cos your heart when I stop to recite
Baby I adore you I see you smiling
That hour glass figure always profiling
I see tears in your eyes many times cos I lie
I apologise and you still by my side
Strong as a brother through thick and thin
I'm very proud to call you my best friend
All I ask is between us keep it tight
A down ass girl keep your head up all right?

Chorus:
Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight

Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight

Now young ? in the hood especially Inglewood
Be independent that's all to the good
Cos no one can be you but you
That's true
Don't let no man stop what you really wanna do
And that's your decision
Fools be on a mission
The next day they be dismissing
Dat ass
The main thing was hit and dash
No love at all with his homies he laughed
You once was a zero
You once was his hero
In your wildest dreams you were a sex fiend
Look here baby you all lady no doubt
And you don't need no knucklehead to turn you out
It's been proven many times you hold your own ground
The origin of a woman is so profound
So much love to you baby
Let it ride to the night
And keep everything tight

Chorus:
Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight

Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight

Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight


Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight


Now hey ladies scream if you know what I mean
And choose a down bro to me on that team
One that will be there in any kind of weather
A fellow that's clever
Always in forever
But we not the only ones that ? to this game
Sometimes you slip up and call another mans name
And I'm like damn where that come from
I thought you were my lady my only one
Deception and the truth is a real thin line
Mixed with the lies they hurt all the time
All a nigga wants is a girl that's down
And all a fiffi is a man to be around
Like bitches be around feeling mad tired sad
It's a 50/50 deal that you treat each other right
That's on the real so y'all
Keep it tight



Chorus:
Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight

Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight

Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight


Keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
Keep it tight baby
Baby keep it tight
