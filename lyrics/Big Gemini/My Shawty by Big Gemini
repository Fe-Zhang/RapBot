Chorus: Bebop
Oooh, that's my shawty
Ain't no one like that
Thats Down to ride for me
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

[Big Gemini]
(Verse 1)
My shawty hold me down
Connected to the ground
When money wasn't there
She didn't care, shit, she stuck around
Do all the tears she cried, pain that I cause inside
I
Owe you, baby, for stickin' by
My side
Whoa-oh, oh
Even when your family didn't want you with me
Said, "Baby, don't believe him
He only out there cheatin'
He only want one thang, and once he get it, girl
He leavin'
That's my
Sh, oh-or-ty, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Some find it hard to say this
But me, I choose to say it
I praise the good that God has gave me with no hesitation
Regardless, what it is
The smallest or the largest gift
I thankful for it, sold it for
I treat it like it's heaven sent
And shawty, that's just what you are
I couldn't ask you for nothing more
Treat me good and treat me right
And look way past all of my flaws
Cause I ain't perfect, ma
You know that I'm far from that
From thangs that I did in my past
To make your heart shatter like glass
But now, it seems as though a change gon' come
And a change gon' be
In the form of a son
Cause now my shawty
Fin' to have my shawty
That means my baby fin' to have my baby for me
Oooh yeah

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Bebop
See me count on little mama that's (Fly)
Stay by ya side, like them 28"s on a (Glide)
Oh, whoa, whoa (Uh oh)
Don't let her go
You should go home
Tell for your man, that's for sure
Ladies, if you put it down light (Like that)
That'll let your man know you on the right track (Right track)
See, I do little thangs
And I done been through pain
But I done say no to change
When I find my shawty

Repeat Chorus
