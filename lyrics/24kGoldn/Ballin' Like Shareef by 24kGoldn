[Intro]
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Is mayonnaise an instrument?

[Chorus]
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field

[Verse]
Shaq attack, I post up in the paint
Back it up, shawty I got no complaints
Racks on racks, yeah that's money in the bank
Ain't no limit to this shit, I just might pull up in a tank
2-3 on my back, and I ain't talkin' Jordan
She think I'm Shareef when she just see the way I'm scorin'
Skrrt, whippin' foreigns, plottin' on the fortress
My outfit cost a fortune, you still rock Michael Kors shit
Catch me out in Boston, like '09 Shaq I'm saucin'
[?] finally get it boppin' to the mornin'
Global warming, I think that it's hot in there
Baby look around and you'll see broke niggas is not in here
My diamonds over me, that's Fiji, Crystal Geyser clear
I'm Shaqtin' a Fool, I'm gettin' rowdy, Cavalier
His shawty lookin' mad, I gotta whisper in her ear
"I'm ballin' like Shareef so you should come on over here, yeah"

[Chorus]
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field

[Bridge]
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field

[Chorus]
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field
You know you see me, I be ballin' like Shareef
Breakin' ankles in Balenciaga sneaks
You know you see me, money tall just like O'Neal
My diamonds dancing on the court and in the field
