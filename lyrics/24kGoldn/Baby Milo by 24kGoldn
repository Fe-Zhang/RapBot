[Intro] (x4)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Young Kilo, 24K, I rock Baby Milo
I might have to steal yo' bitch, I should knock it, Neo
Young Kilo, 24K, I rock Baby Milo
I might have to steal yo' bitch, I should knock it, Neo

[Verse]
Ay, beep, beep, beep, that's that money counter, counter
24k the clique, I'm the money founder, founder
Don't fuck with my ex, I could live without her, out her
Still count up these checks, like I'm running powder
Pull up in Porsches, some sticks, ay
Fork in the boat and I whip, ay
Shawty stay glued to my hip, ay
Back to the britch with a chick, ay
She show me love with her lips, ay
I tell her Gaza, she strips, ay
I make it rain off a lick, ay
The Gucci, it cost me a grip, ay
Count up these blues like some crip, ay
These saws like in blunts, like in clips, ay
I smash then I pass to assist, ay
Lame niggas not on the list, ay
Niggas all smoke but it's mist, ay
Shoot out sedans but they missed, ay
I got some racks on my fist, ay
I got some racks on my wrist, ay

[Chorus]
Young Kilo, 24K, I rock Baby Milo
I might have to steal yo' bitch, I should knock it, Neo
Young Kilo, 24K, I rock Baby Milo
I might have to steal yo' bitch, I should knock it, Neo

[Verse]
I like to rock all my Nigo's and Bape
These niggas envy me, they rock the fake
Four hundred the bogo, I don't even skate
And I run up these checks 'cause I cannot be late
My team, we eat, got a steak on the plate
I hit that first day, I do not like to wait
Broke niggas begging, please get out my face
Niggas will hate when they see you do great
Jealousy, that is a bitch nigga trait
Friends turn to foes, they the fascinating race
When they trying my patience, I don't take the bait
Niggas all talk, this shit sound like debate
I'm bout that action, I'm pulling my weight
Ain't no stranger to clappin', pop off with the pipe
And I don't do parking, just open the gate
Niggas is mad 'cause I'm rich and they ain't

[Chorus]
Young Kilo, 24K, I rock Baby Milo
I might have to steal yo' bitch, I should knock it, Neo
Young Kilo, 24K, I rock Baby Milo
I might have to steal yo' bitch, I should knock it, Neo
