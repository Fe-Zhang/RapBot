[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Been here before, seen you often
Walk in the door and then I seen you saucin'
Guess you in your bag right now
'Cause you ain't hit me back right now

[Chorus]
Been here before ('Fore), seen you often (Yeah)
Walk in the door (Door), and then I seen you saucin' (Woah)
Guess you in your bag right now (Now)
'Cause you ain't hit me back right now (Now)
Been here before ('Fore), seen you often (Yeah)
Walk in the door (Door), and then I seen you saucin' (Woah)
Guess you in your bag right now (Now)
Got me looking back right now (Now)

[Refrain]
Baby, don't go away
'Cause I don't wanna throw away
All of the times that we had
Said I broke your heart, that's my bad
Baby, don't go away
Ain't tryna find love today
But you lookin' bad in your birthday
What I gotta do to deserve that?

[Verse]
Claimin' you the one that can change my life (Change my life)
When you know you can't even change my mind (Change my mind)
Millie on the wrist, can't turn back time (Turn back time)
Sticking to the script, you ain't learned your lines (Lines)
Claimin' you the one that can change my life (Change my life)
When you know you can't even change my mind (Change my mind)
Claimin' you the one that always brings the fun
When we both been knowin' that's a goddamn lie

[Chorus]
Been here before ('Fore), seen you often (Yeah)
Walk in the door (Door), and then I seen you saucin' (Woah)
Bet you in your bag right now (Now)
'Cause you ain't hit me back right now (Now)
Been here before ('Fore), seen you often (Yeah)
Walk in the door (Door), and then I seen you saucin' (Woah)
Guess you in your bag right now (Now)
Got me looking back right now (Now)

[Refrain]
Baby, don't go away
'Cause I don't wanna throw away
All of the times that we had
Said I broke your heart, that's my bad
Baby, don't go away
Ain't tryna find love today
But you lookin' bad in your birthday
What I gotta do to deserve that?

[Bridge]
The veil has been lifted, now I see what this is
The times we was kissin', my only addiction
When I'm in my feelings, don't know if you feel it
My pops say you trippin' and I should've listened

[Refrain]
Baby, don't go away
'Cause I don't wanna throw away
All of the times that we had
Said I broke your heart, that's my bad
Baby, don't go away
Ain't tryna find love today
But you lookin' bad in your birthday
What I gotta do to deserve that?

[Chorus]
Been here before ('Fore), seen you often (Yeah)
Walk in the door (Door), and then I seen you saucin' (Woah)
Guess you in your bag right now (Now)
'Cause you ain't hit me back right now (Now)
Been here before ('Fore), seen you often (Yeah)
Walk in the door (Door), and then I seen you saucin' (Woah)
Guess you in your bag right now (Now)
Got me looking back right now (Now)

[Outro]
Been here before, seen you often
Walk in the door and then I seen you saucin'
Guess you in your bag right now
'Cause you ain't hit me back right now, yeah
