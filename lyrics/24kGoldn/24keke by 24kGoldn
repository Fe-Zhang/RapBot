[Intro]
Ayy, two four in the buildin'
And it's the one that got your girl in her feelings (Ayy)
Ayy, two four in the buildin'
And it's the one that got your girl in her feelings

[Chorus]
And she said two four, do you love me?
I said maybe, but you can never, ever, ever have my babies
Cuz' you fucked up, when you dumped me
Now I got a 100 other bitches screamin' cuff me
Poppin' bubbly, tryna fuck me
All I did was be myself and now they love me
Girl you fucked up, when you dumped me
But I'm still down for you always

[Verse]
Damn, fuck you now and forever
My baby is my dog, we be fuckin' bitches together
Pounds, lay it all on the dresser
I seal it in the house, then I give her a little extra
Shawty shook me up but come and hop into my coupe
You didn't know if you was ridin' cuz' there's only room for two
And if you is, I could show you to my crib
And if you down, down, down, then I could show you to my bed(Ayy)
She likin' all my pics, even the recent
My other girl mad, she blockin' and she playin' defense (Ayy)
Can you niggas keep a secret? a-album comin' soon
I pray nobody gonna leak it

[Chorus]
And she said two four, do you love me?
I said maybe, but you can never, ever, ever have my babies
Cuz' you fucked up, when you dumped me
Now I got a 100 other bitches screamin' cuff me
Poppin' bubbly, tryna fuck me
All I did was be myself and now they love me
Girl you fucked up, when you dumped me
But I'm still down for you always

[Hook]
Down, down, down
I'm still down, down, down for you always
Down, down, down
Is you still down, down, down for me always?
Ayy, ayy can you keep a secret?
Album comin' soon I pray nobody gonna leak it
Ayy, can you niggas keep a secret?
Album comin' soon I pray nobody gonna leak it

[Chorus]
And she said two four, do you love me?
I said maybe, but you can never, ever, ever have my babies
Cuz' you fucked up, when you dumped me
Now I got a 100 other bitches screamin' cuff me
Poppin' bubbly, tryna fuck me
All I did was be myself and now they love me
Girl you fucked up, when you dumped me
But I'm still down for you always
