[Intro] (x2)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuckin' on bands quick
Fuckin' on bands quick
Fuckin' on bands quick

[Chorus] (x2)
Young trendsetter, diamonds on my Beretta
Down for whatever, don't care about the weather
Saint Laurent leather, ooh, I'm so clever
Homies by my side, yeah my niggas stick together

[Verse]
Margiela white tee, Goyard on the Nikes
Shawty actin' sheisty, is it 'cause I'm icy
Just slightly, sippin' on a iced tea
Miss her with the Sprite lean
Jump, ho, ninety
And these vintage Trueys from Korea
I left with your girl, nigga, that's why you ain't see her
They be sleepin' on me, swear they got apnea
Wake 'em up, bang, boom, bow, onomatopoeia
Lookin' like a sucker, sorry I don't want to be ya
They sayin' that I fucked her but I ain't never meet her
And these gold chains bouncin' on my fuckin' wife beater
Stay loyal to the soil, I ain't never been a cheater
Turnin' up the heater, pull out eighty on the meter
Play that shit back, boy, keep it on repeat-ah
Coupe two-seater, one second, hundred meters
Y'all niggas some fiends, you pour what in a liter?

[Chorus] (x2)
Young trendsetter, diamonds on my Beretta
Down for whatever, don't care about the weather
Saint Laurent leather, ooh, I'm so clever
Homies by my side, yeah my niggas stick together
