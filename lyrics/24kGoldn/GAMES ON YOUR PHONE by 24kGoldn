[Intro]
D.A. got that dope

[Chorus]
When you up at night all alone
Playing games on your phone
Do I cross your mind? Gotta know
These feelings for you, I can't control
When you up at night (At night), all alone (All alone)
Playing games on your phone (Phone)
Do I cross your mind? (Your mind), gotta know (Gotta know)
These feelings for you, I can't control

[Verse 1]
Tryna figure out just how I feel about you
I just like the fact that I can keep it real around you
All these ups and downs like I lost and found you
Can't believe I'm standing here still without you
When you up at night, do you think about me? Do I cross your mind?
Just wish that you would tell me
If so, then I got a place that we could go
Ain't gon' let you play me like the games on your phone

[Chorus]
When you up at night (At night), all alone (All alone)
Playing games on your phone (Phone)
Do I cross your mind? (Your mind), gotta know (Gotta know)
These feelings for you, I can't control
When you up at night (At night), all alone (All alone)
Playing games on your phone (Phone)
Do I cross your mind? (Your mind), gotta know (Gotta know)
These feelings for you, I can't control

[Verse 2]
So, where you wanna go?
It don't really matter, still get your back blown, ow
Came for a show, I'ma show out
Fuck what you heard, what you know about me?
Not a goddamn thing
Been riding 'round in foreigns switchin' goddamn lanes
Ain't a girl in the world that can make me change
Not as long as you keep playing games, baby

[Chorus]
When you up at night (At night), all alone (All alone)
Playing games on your phone (Phone)
Do I cross your mind? (Your mind), gotta know (Gotta know)
These feelings for you, I can't control
When you up at night (At night), all alone (All alone)
Playing games on your phone (Phone)
Do I cross your mind? (Your mind), gotta know (Gotta know)
These feelings for you, I can't control
