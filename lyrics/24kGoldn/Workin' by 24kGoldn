[Intro]
Don't keep that shit a hunnid, keep it 10k

[Chorus]
I do whatever whenever, ain't no stopping my shine
Custom Chrome Hearts piece, I purchased without checking the price
I peep my bust down Breitling watch when I want to know the time
These niggas like to talk a lot but I don't pay no mind
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
How you think I get the Rolls Royce with the curtains?
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
Million dollar deals got me workin' on my cursive

[Verse]
The shoes, the charms, they both Saint Laurent
Baby I've been workin' hard, so you know I need it all
The Bentley truck, park it right out front
Girl you know I'm eating good, big Nobu for lunch
I'm a bachelor, too many bitches I could smash on
Too many ounces on my dashboard
Sometimes I act an asshole, but bigger than my ego is my cash flow
Workin' every day I want that bag, I want it bad, yo

[Chorus]
I do whatever whenever, ain't no stopping my shine
Custom Chrome Hearts piece, I purchased without checking the price
I peep my bust down Breitling watch when I want to know the time
These niggas like to talk a lot but I don't pay no mind
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
How you think I get the Rolls Royce with the curtains?
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
Million dollar deals got me workin' on my cursive

[Verse]
What you see is what you get, big ol' diamond baguettes
That be hanging around my neck, so niggas keep tryna test
But I pass those, told lil' shawty keep the Mac close
Girl, the way I'm grinding, couple minutes get your back blown

[Pre-Chorus]
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
How you think I get the Rolls Royce with the curtains?
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
Million dollar deals got me workin' on my cursive

[Chorus]
I do whatever whenever, ain't no stopping my shine
Custom Chrome Hearts piece, I purchased without checking the price
I peep my bust down Breitling watch when I want to know the time
These niggas like to talk a lot but I don't pay no mind
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
How you think I get the Rolls Royce with the curtains?
Workin', workin', yeah I'm workin'
Million dollar deals got me workin' on my cursive
