[Intro]
Brrring, brrring, brrring
Hello, this is the plug
Aight I got you
I'll be there in fifteen minutes, see you soon

[Chorus]
This the plug line baby, hit me up, oh whatcha need?
I'm flexin' all these checks, bitch I look like Hercules
This the plug line baby, hit me up, oh whatcha need?
I'm flexin' all these checks, bitch I look like Hercules

[Verse]
I'm flexin' all this guap, bitch I look like Adonis
Your girl fine, but mine look like a goddess
Goin' into overdrive, trainin' like like I'm Thomas
Scam season right now, these niggas ain't honest but
I promise, I'm goin' the farthest
Up in outer space, boy, you look out of place, boy
Money counter running like a race, boy
Too fast, it don't now how to pace, boy
Fendi belt stay wrapped around my waist, boy
Jordan 4's, they always loosely laced, boy
She keep telling me that I'm too based, boy
Business booming like that bass, boy
Catch me kicking back counting cake, boy
Kicking back counting cake, boy

[Chorus]
This the plug line baby, hit me up, oh whatcha need?
I'm flexin' all these checks, bitch I look like Hercules
This the plug line baby, hit me up, oh whatcha need?
I'm flexin' all these checks, bitch I look like Hercules

[Verse]
I should get sponsored by Spalding, cause I just can't stop balling
Plug line blowing up, they won't stop calling
Rocking Vlone, counting checks
Head to the barbershop to line up the flex
Still fucking with my ex, Longchamp she give me neck
Wondering who is next, that shit got me so perplexed
Cartiers on my face, those is just my specs
Touch down in LAX, to go meet with execs
I look down on my phone and see thirty dirty texts
Get my packs in from FedEx, I swear they be the best
Yeah, I get my packs in from FedEx
I swear they be the best, man, I swear they be the best
