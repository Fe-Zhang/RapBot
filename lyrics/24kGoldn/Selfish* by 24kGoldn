LYRICS FROM STREAM

[Intro]
Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone
How are you supposed to help if you don't know what's wrong?
Saying that I'm selfish, I already know
I already know

[Chorus]
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone (Alone)
How are you supposed to help if you don't know what's wrong?
Saying that I'm selfish, I already know (Know)
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone

[Verse]
Trying (Trying), keep on flying (Flying)
Head in the hills, I guess I need some guidance (Ooh)
Goin' off the hood, you need to clean your sinus (Ooh)
I can't keep my silence, I can't keep on hiding, no
Who was the one to had your back on a bad night?
I was the one that had your back, that was last night (Yeah)
You were the one that took me back to my past life (Life)
You don't know what that's like, I won't be the bad guy
Audemars Piguet, I want the wristwatch
Still ain't the right time, you're looking pissed off
Time for me to get going, but I'm trying to get some
You would say the same if you were in my position (Position)

[Pre-Chorus]
Want you to myself in the shows (Shows)
Don't nobody else gotta know (Know)
Same thing I told you before (-fore)
All you gotta do is listen

[Chorus]
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone (Alone)
How are you supposed to help if you don't know what's wrong?
Saying that I'm selfish, I already know (Know)
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone (Alone)
How are you supposed to help if you don't know what's wrong?
Saying that I'm selfish, I already know (Know)
Want you to myself, I don't want to be alone

[Outro]
Self, alone
Help, wrong
Self, know
Self, alone
