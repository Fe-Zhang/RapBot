[Verse]
Red beam, bitch, Darth Vader I'm your father
Red green Gucci beanie cost a couple dollars
Rockin' satin jackets, but no they ain't from Starter (no)
Tryna jack this swag, nigga you is an impostor
I'm gettin' so much chicken (cash), niggas think I work for Foster
Rockin' Cartier frames while I'm bumping to Tha Carter
Stay grippin' like I'm [?], Gucci tiger I'm a monster
Yellow sweater came from Gosha, Goyard belt hold this revolver
Man, that's Gucci, Goyard, Gosha, Goyard pattern causin' nausea
Gucci ghost inhale the blunt, hop out whatever I want
But I ain't got bread to front, Gosha flannel just to stunt (flex)
Said I ain't got bread to front, this Gosha flannel just to stunt, man

[Chorus]
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (aye)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (aye)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (aye)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha, I rock
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (she rock)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (he rock)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (we rock)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha, aye

[Verse]
I got like three phones, fuck shawty that had spilled on my Vlone (fuck her)
Go in into beast mode, toss her a camp cap she get Supreme'd on
Bringin' that bitch to my beach home, summer love I get my fling on
Smash that, then I swing on; smash that with my bling on
Wrist, chains with some rings on, if you a trill nigga this a theme song
My partner got a couple beams on him, my partner got a couple bees on him
My partner got a lot of green on him (cash), my partner got some wrist gleam on him (ooh)
My partner got some new Supreme on him (ooh), my partner got some Gucci Jeans on him, what

[Chorus]
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (aye)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (aye)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (aye)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha, I rock
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (she rock)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (he rock)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha (we rock)
Gucci, Goyard, Gosha, aye
