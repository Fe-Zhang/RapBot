[Chorus]
Ahh, you talkin' funny, it ain't 'bout the money
That get on my nerves
No, you can't blame me for having my babies
'Cause I'm gonna swerve
Feelin' like a punch line, hit it one time
I could tell you're lunchtime in the crunch time
Oh, you wanna talk that, talk that talk
So what's the word?
You talkin' funny, it ain't 'bout the money
That get on my nerves
No, you can't blame me for having my babies
'Cause I'm gonna swerve
Feelin' like a punch line, hit it one time
I could tell you're lunchtime in the crunch time
Oh, you wanna talk that, talk that talk
So what's the word?

[Verse]
Black Murakami cover my body
She keep on lookin', her nigga don't like me
Bodies behind me, can't keep her silent
I killed her pussy, you know what she like, yeah
Watch me skirt then pipe it up
See rich niggas, that might be us
She wanna know 'cause she stay with her friend
I told lil' shawty that it all depend
Done with these bitches, I'm back to the bands
Hunnid racks make me spazz out
Wanna go shop, I love poppin' 'em tags
New outfit with her ass out
Bitch smoke [?] then pass out
Need my bag like cash cow
'Cause I ain't got time, stop playin' with mine
'Less you want a young nigga to lash out
I'm in her bag
It look like a Birkin, huh
Don't make me laugh
I know you niggas is lurkin', huh
Keep on hatin', that shit don't faze me
Crystal clear, I see through HD
Quick change, let me switch lanes
You ain't got plays, please don't hit me

[Chorus]
He's talkin' funny, it ain't 'bout the money
That get on my nerves
No, you can't blame me for having my babies
'Cause I'm gonna swerve
Feelin' like a punch line, hit it one time
I could tell you're lunchtime in the crunch time
Oh, you wanna talk that, talk that talk
So what's the word?
You talkin' funny, it ain't 'bout the money
That get on my nerves
No, you can't blame me for having my babies
'Cause I'm gonna swerve
Feelin' like a punch line, hit it one time
I could tell you're lunchtime in the crunch time
Oh, you wanna talk that, talk that talk
So what's the word?
