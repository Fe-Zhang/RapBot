[Chorus: 24kGoldn]
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed

[Verse 1: 24kGoldn & Lil Tjay]
I fuck her long, ain't no Minute Maid, my diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy
I'm a young, rich nigga, bitch, it's always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today
So I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship, we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case (Oh)
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess (Oh, oh, oh)
And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: 24kGoldn & Lil Tjay]
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino ('Tino)
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino ('Sino)
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw (Yeah)
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino (I don't want)
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino (Shawty on my dick)
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw (Oh)
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I don't want that bitch, I get the money, lotta bankrolls (I just want the rolls)
I won't never give that ho a dollar, she might think so (I just want the rolls)
She know I'm too wavy, sauce like gravy, check my rank though (I just want the rolls)
Smoking Cali dope, boy, this that potent, but it stank though (Smokin' on this dope)
I'm just stacking money, make it count, no piggy bank though (I'ma stack this cash)
I just got my blunt, shawty right here sipping drank though
Got me fucked up, we go toolie, like I'm Draco
He don't want no smoke, bitch, I'm quick to let that thing go (No, no, no)
Shit ain't really nothing, I stay dripping Valentino
You might think you dripping, your shit foofie, nigga, we know
Five bands, spend it on a fit, that's OD though
I got Valentino from my top down to my feet though

[Chorus: 24kGoldn & Lil Tjay]
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino ('Sino)
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw (Like a, uh)
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino (Just want Valentino)
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
(I fuck her—) I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino ('Tino)
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed

[Outro: 24kGoldn]
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
