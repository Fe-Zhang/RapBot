[Chorus] (x2)
Call me Babe Ruth, I knock it out the park
Bust through your front door blastin' like Tony Stark
You a sea lion, me, I'm a shark
I eat niggas like you for breakfast, yeah I ain't got no heart

[Verse]
Y'all ain't really got the juice, don't be mad
It's the truth, hit 'em like in Babe Ruth, then I dip like deuce
Dip dab, that's the swag, shawty loose off the Goose
Charged her like Zeus, all black like Bruce Wayne
Rockin' two chains, countin' blue things
Reachin' new planes, hittin' new stains
Keep your head up, don't be brainless
How you got a Glock but you can't even aim it
Low key famous, frontin' with the waitress
Really hate to wait shit, yes I'm impatient
Young OG, baby, no replacement
Trappin' out the basement, never give a statement
They gaze in amazement
Like how a nigga drop bands on a bracelet
Like how a nigga in the middle, two girls adjacent
Sixteen years old, he live like he made it
Sixteen years old, you spend your days hatin'
No slander, it's facts that I'm statin'
Move weight like yeah, I'm pushing these plates, and
She your girl, but it's her face that I'm paintin'
Tryna cop a cream Benz, go datin'
Old bogo so the logo be fadin'
Thumbs up, that's what everybody ratin'
She see me, and then she get to faintin'
I go verse for verse like I was tradin'
Each song getting better, I'ma pray then
Get with ties, nigga, start updatin'
Best in the Bay, ain't not debatin'
Best in the Bay

[Chorus] (x2)
Call me Babe Ruth, I knock it out the park
Bust through your front door blastin' like Tony Stark
You a sea lion, me, I'm a shark
I eat niggas like you for breakfast, yeah I ain't got no heart
