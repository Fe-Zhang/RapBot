[Intro: Kaash Paige]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: 24kGoldn]
I told him, "Forget shawty that you thought you had
'Cause she's waitin' for me, nigga, that's my bad"
If I said, "I want you", could we make that last?
If I said, "I loved you", would you say that back?

[Chorus: 24kGoldn & Kaash Paige]
That's unbelievable
'Cause I'm shooting for the stars, baby, tryna make it large
That's unachievable
What they been sayin' all my life, but they never got it right
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
And I'm feelin' so close, tryna live what I know (Unbelievable)
That's unbelievable
That they hated all my life, but they never got it right, no

[Verse: Kaash Paige & 24kGoldn]
They said I'ma be big (Oh)
I'm like, "How they like with this music shit?" (Oh)
Be in the studio, pray I'ma be rich (I'ma be rich)
In place with my next bitch
We screaming, "Fuck the money that you think you had" (Think you had)
'Cause that means nothing to what we have (Yeah)
Top 100 making niggas mad (Yeah)
Pull up to the function, Benjis in my bag
I'm balling, I'm balling (I'm balling)
I'm balling on you (Balling on you)
The labels keep calling (Calling)
I can't pick and choose (I can't pick and choose)
The ladies, they love me (They love me)
They love what I do (They love what I do)
Tryna come kick it
Come chill at the stu' (Come chill at the stu')

[Pre-Chorus: 24kGoldn]
I told him, "Forget shawty that you thought you had
'Cause she's waitin' for me, nigga, that's my bad"
If I said I want you, could we make that last?
If I said I loved you, would you say that back?

[Chorus: 24kGoldn, with Kaash Paige]
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
'Cause I'm shooting for the stars, baby, tryna make it large
That's unachievable (Unachievable)
What they been sayin' all my life, but they never got it right
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
And I'm feelin' so close, tryna live what I know (Unbelievable)
That's unbelievable (Unbelievable)
They been hatin' all my life, but they never got it right, no
