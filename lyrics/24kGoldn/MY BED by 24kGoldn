[Intro]
You wanna play, I'm not with the games, so don't even try, yeah
Hit up my phone, leave me alone, get out of my head
You was tryna break my heart, that's what they all said
Swear that you ain't been the same since you left my bed

[Chorus]
You wanna play, I'm not with the games, so don't even try, yeah
Hit up my phone, leave me alone, get out of my head
You was tryna break my heart, that's what they all said
Swear that you ain't been the same since you left my bed, hey

[Verse]
You been actin' different, baby (Uh)
What you been sippin' on? 'Cause that don't look like Lipton, baby (No)
I wanna take you back, you know that you could get it, baby (Yeah)
But you keep sayin' that you done and that you fucking hate me (Woah), you really drive me crazy
I just wanna know, do you even wanna be mine?
Up at three AM, girl, what happened to your bedtime?
You was all on my mind, thought I was the right guy
Lost her to the night light, guess she wasn't my type

[Chorus]
You wanna play, I'm not with the games, so don't even try, yeah
Hit up my phone, leave me alone, get out of my head
You was tryna break my heart, that's what they all said
Swear that you ain't been the same since you left my bed
You wanna play, I'm not with the games, so don't even try, yeah (No)
Hit up my phone, leave me alone, get out of my head (My head)
You was tryna break my heart, that's what they all said (All said)
Swear that you ain't been the same since you left my bed (My bed)
You wanna play, I'm not with the games, so don't even try, yeah (No)
Hit up my phone, leave me alone, get out of my head (My head)
You was tryna break my heart, that's what they all said (All said)
Swear that you ain't been the same since you left my bed
