You ain't talking money, shut your mouth
I ain't got the time to hear you whine, so cut it out now
These bitches only want you for the double cup plug
Only came to see the section, they ain't showin' no love
She just asked me for a drink, had to tell her, "Hold up"
Never cared 'bout what they think, I ain't giving no fucks
Uh, damn, here we go again

Damn, damn, wasn't in the plan

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Come fuck with me and my friends, we ain't even gotta be friends, baby
Jumped in my DM, hit the club right 'round ten, baby
Looking at me close, watching all the money I spend, baby
Cullinan and coat, now she sayin' I'm the man
I'm only tryna help you understand, baby
Don't come around and do it for the 'Gram, baby
Mmh, cut you off quick, I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
If you suck on my dick, I'm just playin', then I'm playin'
I gotta go, can't lay up with you, no
By tomorrow, have another you, oh

You can go, baby, you excused, oh, oh, baby (Zoovier)
