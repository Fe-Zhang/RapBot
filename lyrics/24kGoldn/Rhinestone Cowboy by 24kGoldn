[Hook]
Rhinestone Cowboy cop another chain (cop another chain)
Diamonds in my mouth but baby this ain't Johnny Dang (this ain't Johnny dang)
Ain't this for the clout now, Ain't this for the fame (ain't this for the fame)
All I want is money, all I want is brain (all I want is brain)
Rhinestone Cowboy cop another chain (cop another chain)
Diamonds in my mouth but baby this ain't Johnny Dang (this ain't Johnny dang)
Ain't this for the clout now, Ain't this for the fame (ain't this for the fame)
All I want is money, all I want is brain (all I want is brain)

[Verse 1]
Rhinestone Cowboy pull up in a horsey
Niggas throwing shade because they bitches just adore me
She got that booty so I be geekin' acting dorky
Gotta keep a knife because these bitches wanna fork me
Wanna fork me, whats up on your plate hoe
Rhinestones on my teeth, you need that ice if you gone skate bro (shine, shine, shine)
Drive by on that stallion I hit you with that draco (grrrahh)
Ice pack on medallion my neck it cost a bankroll (ice, ice)
Cost a bankroll, money piling sideways
Flip it in the air and now that shit as tall as Taipei
Pull up foreign whip its sitting pretty in the driveway
10 bad bitches only room for 8 on my space
Trying to pipe so I take her back to my place
Told that bitch to giddy up, she saddle up and ride me (neigh)
She said 24k the best I want him deep inside me
Catch my nut and dip i hope that shorty never find me

[Verse 2]
Shorty fucking with me because she know I am a cowboy
Shorty fucking with me because she really like my style boy
Got 2 pistols on me just in case its gettin' wild boy
Rhinestone shining on my belt they wet like [?] boy
I'm a playboy I ain't gotta hide that
Rhinestone on my jacket shining bright like screen an iPad
Shorty ass so fat she send a pic I need a I-max
Couple minutes in and she already finna climax
Finna climax, headed to the top hoe
Call me [?] that money it won't stop yo
Niggas finna stare when I be sliding in that drop yo
Bands on the carriage it ain't even got a top though
Got no top so I'm chilling in the breeze
Counting up that guap, yeah, counting up that cheese
Yellow lemon diamonds bitch, my jewels is freshly squeezed
Doors of opportunity and bitch I got the keys
