[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Oh, oh
(Oh-oh-oh) Oh, (Oh-oh-oh) oh (Hey, yeah)
(Oh-oh-oh) Oh, (Oh-oh-oh) oh (Let's go)
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
We started off a team
Party 'til we fall asleep
Even on the street, when we disagreed
We did it on beat (Did it on beat)
Expected unique (Right), anything less, it was weak
The music of the strings made life complete (Facts)
'Til that one day they changed everything
The Pop Trolls started snatchin' up all of the strings (Oh no)
Put the melodies on top of poppy lil' beats
They cut us out of the scene
And then forgot what it really means (Not even publish us)
Shoulda seen between all of the scheming
It seems like the Trolls they stole from were meaningless
Walkin' around like they were the geniuses
But it's only samples, autotune and remixes (No, lawd)
I'm a vegan, I don't have no beef with them (No, lawd)
Gotta protect my kingdom
But the dream is to sing again (Yes, yes)
Being friends, seamless blend
Harmony ain't hard when the keys within you win

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
First, it was all love (At first, it was all love)
Hands up, super star love (Stars up)
That you can have it, you can have it all, love (And you can get it how you want)
But then you took it, took it all, love (They took it all)
All, love
Turn it up louder (Turn the music up louder)
Sing along, get the crowd up (Get the crowd up, come on)
But then you took it all, love (Took it all, love)
Then forgot all about us (Oh), but it's all love

[Post-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Mary J. Blige]
I feel you
Sounds good in my ear when I hear it like that
I feel you
I say I look good to the mirror and it says it right back
I feel you
A little love wouldn't kill you
You really did me wrong, it was real cruel (It was real cruel)
Had a lot of love and I still do 'cause I feel you

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Next morning, the elders were on me (Man)
They saw the warning signs, couldn't ignore it (Look)
Had to figure out how to save the way of life they had made
So they made a play
The Pop Trolls were comin' for it all (Ah, ah)
All for one and one for all (Ah)
So the only way we saw, how we saw it
It was one thing left to be done (What?)
Each leader grabbed a single string and said, "Run!"
