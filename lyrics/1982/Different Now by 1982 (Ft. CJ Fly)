[Hook: CJ Fly]
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
Things are different now, things are different
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
Things are different now, things are different

[Verse 1: Termanology]
I used to let myself down
Believing the people, I almost had a meltdown
Put on rappers from the law and helltown
But when it came to doing work they was never round
I did it myself, so I ain't splittin' my wealth
Where the fuck was everybody when I needed some help?
My brain smoking
It get me so heated, it melt
Can't help no one
I'm focused on feeding myself
Careful
Puttin' so much faith in your friends, it's unbearable
When you see they snakes in the end
In high school, I had to beat the brakes off my man
Punched him so many times, I end up breaking my hand
Had to promise myself, I was taking a stand
No more puttin' up with friends that's fake as the gram
We used to throw parties, watch my face on demand
Me and the clan
But now it's just me and the fam
Things change

[Hook: CJ Fly]
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
Things are different now, things are different
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
Things are different now, things are different

[Verse 2: Termanology]
You move flagrant
No longer can I take it
Even your body outgrows things and makes changes
So if it's toxic, no longer can I rock wit'
I'm not willing to sell my piece for a profit
Fuck the gossip, I'm level and obnoxious
Bettering all my options, deading you in the process
I gave her mad chances, they gave me bad answers
Smacked me right dead in the face, and left hand prints
Left me stranded, no way to reprimand it
So I just remove myself from all cancers
Took advances, rephrase: took advantage
Thinkin' that 'cus I got a good heart, you can scam shit
And it, wasn't my intentions to do this song
Like it wasn't your intentions to do me wrong (wrong)
But when respect gets tossed and it truly is gone
Then we just move on
Life goes on

[Hook and Outro: CJ Fly]
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
Things are different now, things are different
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
Things are different now, things are different
I won't let you down
I won't let you
Things are different now, things are different now
