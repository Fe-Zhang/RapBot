[Intro]
Statik Selektah
Yo, I love when Statik send me beats like this
Everybody wanna send me shit for me to spit 90,000 bars over
But this real shit is when I hit my pocket (Facts)
'Cause you know the love don’t stop, baby, real shit
And in this difficult time, shout out to the fans
Salute, they been real
'Cause you know the love don't stop, baby
Ricky and Takeover forever (I love you), uh

[Verse 1]
Six months and it feels like a lifetime (A lifetime)
I still don’t wanna write rhymes
They bring ya names up, it's never the right time (Never)
Still, the light shines
That bitch motherfucker who did it (Faggot), they found him in Rhode Island, hidin' (Yup)
Stabbed him up in Rikers, heard he's barely survivin' (Fuck 'em)
Came to court bandaged up with a cane (Yeah)
I thought I'd feel better, but it still feels the same (Still feel like shit)
Everybody's still in pain, but somehow, we movin’ on
Shit, I still can’t believe you's are gone (For real)
If it was one of you, that shit would forever bother me
But both of you’s in one night? That shit took a part of me
I never understood how people got depressed
But now I fully understand with this weight all on my chest (Facts)
We always said "Until the casket drop"
But I'm still reppin' after that and that'll never stop (Rah)

[Chorus]
And even though you’s are gone, your names'll live on
'Cause the love don't stop, baby, and I promise you
As long as there's blood runnin' through my motherfuckin' veins
Everybody will remember your name, because the love don't stop, baby (Let's go, yo)

[Verse 2]
My pen scribble graffiti colors, a genius brother
Uplift my ghetto and feed my brothers, we need each other
Free Gutta, sad every time that I see your mother
I know you goin' through pain, I hate to see you suffer
Spent half of your life caged, when the kites came
I always respond and try to keep in touch, but I'm gone
Busy hustlin', you know I got two babies and they pay me to rap
Promise I never would be lazy, so this pen scribblin'
I hope you livin' in Middleton
As soon as I get a minute, I'ma pull up and visit then reminiscin'
You had drama, I pulled up with two hammers
I put 'em both in your hands and I told you, "Go 'head and handle"
That's on my nana, mama, my kids and both of my grandmas
Passed you them cannons and prayed that you'd never see the slammer
Psychological damage we been through, it fucked us up
But that's the reason I'm so nice with this pen, so the struggle (The struggle)

[Chorus]
And even though you's are gone, your names'll live on
'Cause the love don't stop, baby, and I promise you
As long as there's blood runnin' through my motherfuckin' veins
Everybody will remember your names, because the love don't stop, baby

[Outro]
Ricky and Takeover, rah
