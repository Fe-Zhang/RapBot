[Intro]
Yeah (Statik Selektah)
It's all facts
'Ology

[Verse 1]
You ever hear them paddy wagon tires pullin' up
'Cause you got them cocaine baggies fillin' up?
Now they bangin' on your door and you gotta flush
At any moment you captured, man, what a rush
Forty-four with the broken pin, never been as broke as him
The roaches on ya toaster have you close to sin
So them fiends, had to rope 'em in
I promised my mama she'd never be broke again
Slap the ho, slap the hater, what's the difference?
They press charges, it's one year in imprisonment
I'm on some different shit (Facts)
Hit your bitch, hit the strip, get the grip, split ya shit
The alcohol make my nerves calm
Head up, eyes open, baby boy, yeah, word is bond
Rest in peace to Guru and to HeadQCourterz
Swear to God, I shoulda been a member of the slaughter

[Chorus]
I'm Gang Starr, I'm Mobb Deep, I'm Wu-Tang
I'm M.O.P., I'm Dipset, the Byrd Gang
I'm De La, I'm Tribe Called, I'm BDP
I'm Griselda, GOOD Music, TDE (Uh)

[Verse 2]
I got a scary team, whole clique carry beams
I'm talkin' big cannons like Mary Jean
Got one of the biggest hammers that you ever seen
Them crime scenes, I shut 'em down like Filene's
A lot of speed like Adonis Creed
You don't want your family rockin' you on a tee
Still eatin' poke where the hoes stay
Dom P with the OJ, I'm O'Shay
I wrote thirty-nine albums and produced two
So pardon me if I'm lookin' at you like, "Who's you?"
No, I never sold a lot like U2
But this gun'll make 'em strip and you, too
Who's who? These rappers, they all sound alike
Every city, every hood, yeah, I'm down to fight
Tellin' stories, but leavin' out all the key pieces
You boys actin' like clowns, Joaquin Phoenix

[Chorus]
I'm Gang Starr, I'm Mobb Deep, I'm Wu-Tang
I'm M.O.P., I'm Dipset, the Byrd Gang
I'm De La, I'm Tribe Called, I'm BDP
I'm Griselda, GOOD Music, TDE

[Verse 3]
I dissected the greatest rappers and made 'em ashes
Burn them fools like a baby mama do her taxes
It's straight madness how I mentally abuse
I'm Ike Turner, you rappers Tina, I'll whip you fools
Get on your knees, praise the rap god
I'll rock your bitch's bells like James Todd
You lame frauds always gonna remain lost
While me and my killas enjoyin' them days off
Many scars on my face 'cause I been to war
A way different reason you boys in it for
I'm here for the glory, they gon' tell my story
With the greatest, you in a separate category
You ever been in a trap house with the black windows
And ounces in the fridge? Yeah, we hid those
Nah, I didn't think so, I'm a special guy
The one percent in this rap game that never lied

[Chorus]
I'm Gang Starr, I'm Mobb Deep, I'm Wu-Tang
I'm M.O.P., I'm Dipset, the Byrd Gang
I'm De La, I'm Tribe Called, I'm BDP
I'm Griselda, GOOD Music, TDE
I'm Gang Starr, I'm Mobb Deep, I'm Wu-Tang
I'm M.O.P., I'm Dipset, the Byrd Gang
I'm De La, I'm Tribe Called, I'm BDP
I'm Griselda, GOOD Music, TDE
