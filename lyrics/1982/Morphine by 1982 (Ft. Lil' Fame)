[Intro: Termanology]
Yeah
Uh (Statik Selektah)
Here we go

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Kidnappings, alibis, drive-bys
I been there, there's paperwork, so why lie?
Four-fives, bullets spittin', flesh cookin'
Now you bare, fitted, body on the best cushion
Hah, I came to dinner with a meat cleaver
Bam, I get you hit up with a street sweeper
Unique dreamer that's whippin' the green Bimmer
In them clean sneakers, I spent my feature money on reefer
Reach for my piece, you fittin' to meet Jesus
I'm a street genius, before rap, I sold heaters
It's no weakness, runnin' with cold creatures
Put a bullet into your bitch and kill your fetus
Cement shoes, they don't know where your feet is
Closed casket, no clothes, you're at the griever's
It's up to me, make a killin' off the morphine
The fiends come and we hit 'em with the quarantine

[Interlude: Lil Fame]
Brr (Yeah)
Statik Selektah, Termanology, Fizzy, ahh

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
Ayo, I'm loyal to my brand (M.O.P.)
Grand Royal to my brand (M.O.P.)
Nigga, I spit fire, y'all can't deny it
Y'all fold under pressure, I was taught to apply it
I spit that raw shit, that old go-to-war shit
And leave it all over the track like horse shit
Spaz-matic, I spaz with it
See that cloth that you cut from? I wouldn't wipe my ass with it
Analyze my vocals, I'm the motherfucker you go to
I leave niggas puzzled like Sudoku
I blam a nigga down, I specialize in street carpentry
Yeah, I hammer niggas down
You know how we do, ran a nigga down
Went upside of his head and beat the camera nigga down (C'mon)
M.O.P. and Showoff, we be the raw team
Statik, hit 'em with the quarantine
