[Intro: Kota the Friend & CJ Fly]
(Woah) Oh, (Woah) yessir, (Oh, Statik Selektah)
Brooklyn, what the fuck? (Woah)
Statik (Woah), yeah, yeah (Oh), yo

[Verse 1: Kota the Friend]
True and livin', I heard spring showers bring new beginnings
Looser women, dollars with few conditions, that's two admissions
New religions painted these pictures vivid, they true to vision
New commissions comin', they gotta get through the two dimensions
Don't believe in luck, see blessings and I assume position
Move with purpose, get through the turbulence with a crude ambition
Gatekeeper's peekin', I see him movin' with cruel intentions
I just keep it pushin' and keep pursuin' these new inventions
Said it, I meant it, and if I get it, I penned it
And if you read it on Reddit then you ain't gettin' my message
I'm like the organic produce, nothin' but real in my section
I seen my niggas go postal, I had some permanent lessons
I got my hands sittin' ten and two, winnin' even when I lose
Kota's Arc, all of my blessings be comin' in in twos
Know the truth, don't take no wooden nickels and play the fool
That just make it easier to play these fools, yeah

[Chorus: Kota the Friend & CJ Fly]
They need somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
This shit is so undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all
They need somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
This shit is so undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all (Fly)

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
I been gettin' better as I age, just like some corked wine
Don't gotta use a sundial to see these dark times
Somehow we could see it all peekin' through our blinds
I went from sittin' in the court to sittin' court side
Fiends still snort lines, police, they report crimes
What, think we support swine the way we eat pork rinds?
More fire, gettin' more fire
I'm Rick and Morty fly, I leave you mortified
Very few rappers state the facts and even more tell lies
I lay my vocals onto wax then I'm immortalized
This quarantine ain't nothin' new, I'm used to bein' the illest
I stay away from all these parasites that stay tryna kill us
While you lil' niggas out in the club, I'm cozy in bed
With my Puerto Rican mamí that sound like Rosie Perez
How the fuck did they let corona get spread?
Why you think I'm messed up? Can't let it go to my head (Fly)

[Chorus: Kota the Friend]
They need somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
This shit is so undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all
They need somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
This shit is so undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Kota the Friend]
I used to pray to the Holy Bible I'll smoke my rivals
I was focused on survival, drownin' in the open bottle
Henny and more Moscato, found me a new whore to follow
I poke her then bought McDonald's, that's somethin' we both ain't proud of
Demons, they actin' friendly, play victim and act and tell me
They trippin' and actin' petty, I'm dippin' and that's a Fendi
I used to pack a semi, wildin' off of 'gnac and Remy
Jacket, Pelle, ready to rock you if you actin' jelly
Sippin' Circoc with Jerry, them cowards killed Dr. Sebby
And Malcolm, not accidentally, we pop when his ass offendin'
Biggie and Makaveli and Nipsey and Pop already
My tears, they be droppin' steady, I'm ready to start some vetting
This shit depressin', I spit these lessons and hope you listen
If it's a issue, address it so we can try and fix it
While they be rhymin' fiction and spittin' them lines specific
My poems are honest written, so they cannot sound malicious

[Chorus: Kota the Friend]
Somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
This shit is so undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all
They need somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
This shit is so undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all

[Outro: Kota the Friend]
Somethin' relatable, somewhat unbreakable, tryna escape it all
So undebatable, make it obtainable, someone to save 'em all
