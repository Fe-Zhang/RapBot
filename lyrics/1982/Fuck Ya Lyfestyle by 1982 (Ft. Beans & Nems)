[Verse 1:]
I had roaches in My toaster , so gross you wanna throw up
My Mom flicked the shit off the bread , and told Me grow up
I still ate it , eyes lit like Las Vegas ,grew up on government help
Still famous , drug money run in My veins like the >slicker dude ❓❓<
My crew stomps rappers to death , go head pick a shoot
I don't care if you're 5 ft. or you're 7'2" , make a spectacle outta your face with the Heckler dude
