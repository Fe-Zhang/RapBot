[Intro]
Statik Selektah

[Chorus]
Does it all even matter
If you can always find a bitch that's badder?
If she can find a richer nigga with status
We can't take any of it with when they bury us
Does it all even matter?
Does it all even matter?
Does it all even matter? (Uh)

[Verse 1]
I ain't lettin' no negativity live in me
Used to see cloudy, now it's clear like a Tiffany
Gotta be kiddin' me, I'm in touch with my synergy
Stay away from people who always stuck in they misery
Let's make history doin' music consistently
Do it for the love and I do it for the kids to eat
This pure victory, I'm celebratin'
Whole squad elevated, yeah, my life good and it been amazin'

[Chorus]
Does it all even matter
If you can always find a bitch that's badder?
If she can find a richer nigga with status
We can't take any of it with when they bury us
Does it all even matter? (Uh, uh)
Does it all even matter?

[Verse 2]
2020 turn my vision to a lifestyle
I know you heard me, mid-twenties been tight while
I made so many bad decisions, but I'm alright now
Get out your feelings, get the chicken 'til it's lights out
Follow me on my frequency surroundin' me
My daddy wasn't around, but he's still proud of me
I got my money up, I study economy
And now she wanna bone like archaeology

[Chorus]
But does it all even matter
If you can always find a bitch that's badder?
If she can find a richer nigga with status
We can't take any of it with when they bury us
Does it all even matter?
Does it all even matter?
Does it all even matter? (Nah)

[Verse 3]
Been a while since I got on a track
Ran through the bag, but I got it all back
SUV's all black, eighty-two all facts
Quarantine time me and next season we back

[Outro]
Ayo, Statik, love you, baby
This Freaky Yayo talkin'
I'm lookin' for The Balaning Act
The Roc is askin' for it, baby, what's goin' on over here?
