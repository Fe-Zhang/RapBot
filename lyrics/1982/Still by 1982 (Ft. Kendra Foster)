3 x Still on top


[Verse 1:]
Your boy's slick like an alligator
Cocaine marinator throw flames at a hater
Shit , I've been fly since I had a Sega
Your shorty lost man , I had to save Her
I grew poor this shit's caught us
Now it's iced out , diamonds for the tallest
And I'm getting money regardless , give a fuck if ya starving
Bitch, I'm James Harden motherfucker I mean balling
Muddy crawls down the
