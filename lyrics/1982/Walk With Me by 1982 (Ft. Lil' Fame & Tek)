[Intro]
Statik Selektah
Walk with me
Walk
Walk with me, let's go
Walk, walk with me

[Verse 1]
The realist, twin birth in a theory
I'm one person that could tell you the full story (Ow)
Lazy eye, ill temper (Ill temper)
I bully anything that look different (The fuck outta here)
Voice high-pitch, quick to smack a bitch (Psh-psh)
I'm sellin' crack just to get rich (Damn)
Got my aunt and my sister in place
Like the man in the industry with 'slave' on his face
Dearly beloved, thugs cry undercover (Cry undercover)
Paint a perfect picture but we think nothin' of it (Nah)
You see, Basquiat grew his dreads out (Dreads out)
The stress of his life, threw his meds out (Threw his meds out)
We self-healin', black melanin appealin'
Curly hair, dark skin, we're God's children (Wow)
I shoot dice in the hood
Tell the young bulls, "Come fuck with me, we all good", uh-huh

[Chorus]
Yeah, come on, take a walk with me
Where them clips blow, this is every zip code
Let that bitch go rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tow
Real talk, homie, walk
Yeah, come on, take a walk with me
Where they bang at and niggas do they thang at
This where we hang at, I got that hawk with me
Motherfucker, take a walk with me

[Verse 2]
Walk with me through the gutter, mane
Where they cuttin' 'caine, both pockets full of rubber bands
Puffin' strange 'til my eyeball colors change
Back in the days couldn't have no watches and chains
Couldn't walk around without the thang
Tryna floss in they face get you tossed in the grave
Every zip code hustle hard and get low
Where them cars, the Benzos, do it large and get dough
This the ghetto, thirty-eight specials
Smith & Wessons, shotties, nine millis, TECs blow
Passive aggressive how the goons be
Line you up and get to steppin' with your jewelry
Gunshots, we used to those, we shoot at foes
Polo down head to toe, shoes and clothes
Could lose your soul, fuck around, lose your gold
Everything is on the go, lemme bring you on a stroll

[Chorus]
Yeah, come on, take a walk with me
Where them clips blow, this is every zip code
Let that bitch go rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tow
Real talk, homie, walk
Yeah, come on, take a walk with me
Where they bang at and niggas do they thang at
This where we hang at, I got that hawk with me
Motherfucker, take a walk with me
