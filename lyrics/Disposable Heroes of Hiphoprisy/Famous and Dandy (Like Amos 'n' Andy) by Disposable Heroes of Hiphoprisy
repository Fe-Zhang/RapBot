[Hook:]
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos 'n' Andy
(2x)

[Verse I]
It's quite a spectacle
To see us land in
Waste receptacles
As if we've planned it
We're never skeptical
When we get branded
Then disrespectful
Cause we feel abandoned
The height of mediocrity
Is the challenge
Crawling through the entrails
Of imbalance
We learn to like to be the heroes
We learn to lie to the brand name negroes
We learn to laugh to avoid being angry
We learn to kill and learn to go hungry
We learn not to feel, for protection
And we learn to flaunt when we get an erection

[Hook:]
What will we do to become famous and dandy
Just like Amos 'n' Andy
(2x)

[Verse II]
We're born believing we're greater than circumstance
Infinitely stronger than chance
As our first breath is handed
We taste the double standard
The need to wear the mask
And with society's nurturing
The psychic plastic surgery
Begins to take effect
As our souls watch astounded
Our characters flounder
Duplicitous identity
Diction and contradiction
Have become the skills
Of assimilation
Razor honed to perfection
From the moment of creation
It's gone from identity crisis
To survival
Slingshot to rifle
Sin to revival
Try to get looked at
But not poked in the eyeball
Warned of our impurities
Afraid of insecurities
Real life experts of the artificial
Athletes and entertainers
Have become the minstrels
On commercials

[Hook:]

[Verse III]
On screen or off we can be rented
To perform any feat
And we reflect the images presented
By the media's elite
Positive or negative attention
Is viewed as success
U.S.D.A. African American Beef
Is seen as progress
We never ask ourselves
Too many questions
Too much truth in introspection
Maintain the regimentation
And avoid self-degradation
We act out all the stereotypes
Try to use them as decoy
And we become shining examples
Of the system we set out to destroy
Cause even in the most radical groups
You will find
That when you stray from the doctrine
You'll see hard times

[Hook:]

[Verse IV]
Being kicked in the closed mouth
Or smiling with no teeth
They're both choices, yes
But it's impossible to eat
Uneducated, underdeveloped
Undisciplined but mostly unaware
We join the flavor of the month club
We swallow the flavor of the month
Well holding our crotch
Was the flavor of the month
Bitch this Bitch that
Was the flavor of the month
Being a thug
Was the flavor of the month
Then no to drugs
Was the flavor of the month
Kangol
Was the flavor of the month
Rope gold
Was the flavor of the month
Adidas shoes
Was the flavor of the month
Then bashing Jews
Was the flavor of the month
Gentrification
Was the flavor of the month
Isolation
Was the flavor of the month
My pockets are so empty I can feel my testicles
Cause I spent all my money on some plastic African necklaces
And I still don't know what the colors mean...
RED, BLACK AND GREEN

[Hook: x2]
