[Intro: Chip Banks (Lord Superb)]
This is goin' out (Yeah its goin' out right here)
All my Cover Girls, what up? (Yeah, 5'2")
Cover Girl (Baby right there)
Lets go Lords

[Chorus: Donna Summer sample (Chip Banks)]
Ooooooh (East Coast, Down South) how do you like your love?
(All my Cover Girls all over the globe ya'll) how do you like it?
How do you like it? (All my Cover Girls ya know?)
Ooooooh (Cream Teamin' it)
(If you ain't Cream Teamin' it, you dreamin' it)
How do you like your love? (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
How do you like it? How do you like it?

[Chip Banks]
Yo, she said "Banky, are all model cats pretty like Mase?
Do they only date dimes that's slim in the waist?"
I said, "Listen love, let me tell you somethin
I'll hump a pretty dumplin' if she pumpin"
Sat back, legs crossed, cracked open the Draft
Little cigar, bootleg version of Shaft
She said "Daaamn daddy you look good up in ya robe
I swallowed two fire apples now I'm ready un-sewn"
She had a thong on, opps I'm wrong
Full size bloomers on y'all, word, all up in her ass
Dime piece but she knew better then to ask for cash
See Banky like ODB, I hit it wall to wall

[Chorus: Donna Summer sample (Lord Superb)]
More, More, More
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, More, More
How do you like it? How do you like it?
Ooooooh, how do you like your love?
How do you like it? How do you like it?
Ooooooh, (Yeah) how do you like your love? (huh?)
How do you like it? (Power for Power) How do you like it?

[Lord Superb (Chip Banks)]
I like, cinnamon hoes, toes done all the time
She's my sunshine, Spring, my Summertime
Backshot off the rack, and she think with her mouth, off the bat
It was a Monday night, we was all at the gym
Chicks was lookin' good, I was lookin' at them
I knew her name was Kim, from her bottoms and shit
Freakin' the first Jordans, I like the way she rocked em and shit
With a Latifah sweater, her suede wallet was gold
And Guess jeans, thats when I knew she was from Queens
Eyes as a cuisine, us Africans from the Green
She wore, a pinky ring I read "doin' my thing"
She said "My names Kimberly, all my friends call me Quasar
I was born in Eshmar, but my mom's from Madagascar"
(Moves that make you drive a fast car)
Af-African, pretty like Nascar (Nascar)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
