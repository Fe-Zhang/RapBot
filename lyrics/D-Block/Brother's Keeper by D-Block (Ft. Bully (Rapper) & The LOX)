Am I my brother's keeper?
Come to me hungry, I bet ya I feed ya
Come to me cold, I bet ya I clothe ya
Come to me hurt and I bet ya I hold ya

Am I my brother's keeper?
Goddamn right, you should know I'm a soldier
Goddamn right, you can lean on my shoulder
Goddamn right, I'll be there 'til it's over

Yo, let it off without question
Bail money without stressin'
Always in my prayers and my blessin's
Conditional thugs with unconditional love
On a mission of gettin' rich as a mug

Went from popcorn to football
To pitchin' 'em drugs to runnin' gangstas
On a freak bitch from the club
Whatever I got you can get it
If I ain't got it I'ma go out an' get it
We split it, we did it

We caused terror, I'm all error
Everything from the best man to the pallbearer
I'm right there front line with you in the war
Back to back gettin' jumped
Just don't hit the floor

They can't break me, I see it in HD
So before you take one of them, please take me
An' I know it's deep but it gets deeper
Yes I am my brother's keeper

Am I my brother's keeper?
Come to me hungry, I bet ya I feed ya
Come to me cold, I bet ya I clothe ya
Come to me hurt and I bet ya I hold ya

Am I my brother's keeper?
Goddamn right, you should know I'm a soldier
Goddamn right, you can lean on my shoulder
Goddamn right, I'll be there 'til it's over

Know I'm a soldier, know I'ma hold ya
You're ace boon koon, you can say dozer
Damn right, I'm my brother's keeper
Never bite the hand the feeds ya

My home is yours, my dough is yours
Whatever I own brother, know it's yours
Best believe we all we got
If we don't got that, then we all we not, damn

Am I my brother's keeper?
Come to me hungry, I bet ya I feed ya
Come to me cold, I bet ya I clothe ya
Come to me hurt and I bet ya I hold ya

Am I my brother's keeper?
Goddamn right, you should know I'm a soldier
Goddamn right, you can lean on my shoulder
Goddamn right, I'll be there 'til it's over

I don't mean black when I say brother
An' I don't mean you had to come from my mother
Or share the same cover
Definition is answer when I call, fight when I brawl
Your money's my money, we fresher than 'em all

We floored you, that's cool, tomorrow's part two
Cooligan, hooligan, ready to hit the streets
An' act the fool again, blood's thicker than water
We ain't related but Bully's kid's my daughter

Syles P. my brother, Ms. Phillips my mother
And so on nigga
Late night Chinese food and plenty of liquor
Can't learn this on MySpace or FaceBook
But put the book down an' look at his face
Is he your brother?

Am I my brother's keeper?
Come to me hungry, I bet ya I feed ya
Come to me cold, I bet ya I clothe ya
Come to me hurt and I bet ya I hold ya

Am I my brother's keeper?
Goddamn right, you should know I'm a soldier
Goddamn right, you can lean on my shoulder
Goddamn right, I'll be there 'til it's over
