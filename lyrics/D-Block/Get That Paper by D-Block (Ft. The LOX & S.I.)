Little league from rotary to exchange
And I still remember when the first checks came (uh)
Roof in the trunk is how the new Lex came (Woo!)
With the air holes, how the new Tecs came (heheh)
Figure that the higher I get, the less pain
YOu dudes is playin checkers but it's a chess game
Soon as I hit my number, I'm on the next train

Bad chick wit me and we flyin down the throughway, what!
