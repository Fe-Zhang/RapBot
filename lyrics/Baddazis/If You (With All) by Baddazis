Shit go out to all my muhfuckin' niggas''
Got nothing but love for ya' playa'

(Ungh)
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
My niggas', my niggas'
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
My niggas'

My niggas' be dem' niggas' thats cool as fuck
Won't start no shit but'll fuck you up
My niggas' be dem' niggas', smoke dope all day
Same time collect the habit in the field without pay
My niggas' don't kill til' our life in danger
At that time don't give a fuck if you a cousin or stranger
My niggas' be with me on my last dime
My niggas' gon' be with me on my wealthiest times
My niggas' earn they respect like I earn mine
Me and my niggas' do honest shit, but still commit crimes
Unfortunate me and my niggas' still do time
For a costly-ass mistake or some sissy-bitch lyin'
Thats why me and my niggas' stay secluded
Dem' niggas' that fucked us up last time got up-rooted
Booed about the south like it was never they home man
I can't tell you where dem' bitches done gon' man

Yeah' playa hit me wit' cho' best shot
We ricochet everythang that chall' send nigga' what
Got beef, better keep it to yourself like a secret
Don't even go and get to introduce
To twenty-one episodes of shock treatment
My niggas'll bring the head rush
And take y'all niggas' to class like a muthafuckin' school bus
Even Atheist be sayin' "Oh, my God"
When Baeshaun spat a bar arrest your cardiac
So know who got the most heart
For verses y'all caught us at a bad time
We gotta show y'all niggas' the real meanin' of ragtime
Step up and take a fall
Let's brawl
Talkin' shit about cha' cause'
I heard that half of y'all went AWOL
Retaliation for this naw don't bother
We got niggas' in this clique old enough to be your grandfather
You don't have to like it just respect it
Get a bunch of don't give a fuck niggas'
Then we set shit off like Vivica, Thelma and Louise shit
Got hoes that'll run up in yo crib and won't leave shit
Scared to death make em' holler like promotin' Scream
Get up off that crack, weed and that muthafuckin' cream

(ungh)
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
My niggas', my niggas', my nigga', my niggas'
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
My niggas', my niggas', my niggas'

In this day and era, it's more terror than you can bare
So I tote a baretta to handle personal vendettas
Takin' drastic measures
Cause' niggas' be wantin' to wet us
So we put holes in sweaters
Thought we was the goodfellas
Moms use to tell us, the street is gonna get us
Though I respect my elders
I'm tryin' to strive for something better
So grams I had to measure
To keep cheddar like Bank Tellers
And still keep the hollow-heads flyin' like fuckin' Delta
Run for shelter, or do your dumb-ass know no better
When I pull out this pistol, I'mma do more than scare ya'
I'mma tear ya' a brand new asshole
So grab a firm grip and never let go of the double four

You daamn right I'm with my niggas' beyond the end
And don't think I don't know dem' niggas' who ain't my friend
Me and my niggas' been through it all, good or bad
Shit, eatin' or starvin', (what) happy or sad
Shootin' at niggas' or gettin' shot at
Beinglazy not doing shit or making progress
Beatin' the streets or lettin' the streets beat us
Gotta be the nigga' kickin' the dirt, fuck kickin' the dust
My niggas' got high expectations for me
Just as I do for dem'
Watch dem' shabby hoes, they swear to God a nigga' raping em'
So while you fuckin' em' homeboy make sure you tapin' em'
Show the judge you was willin' you wasn't makin' em'
We stand together shit we won't fall
You come to fuck with one you come to fuck with us all nigga'
Stand together we can't fall
You come to fuck with one you came to fuck with us all, my niggas'

(Repeat 4x)
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all
My niggas', my niggas', my niggas'

My niggas' believe in death before dishonor
My niggas' bout' 26 hours, nine days a week, overtime niggas'
My niggas' is trill, raw to the bone
My niggas' wanna see all of us make it
My niggas'
You come to fuck with one you came to fuck wit' us all

All my niggas' in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee
Florida, Louisiana, California, Alabama, New York, Virginia, Oklahoma
Nevada, Jersey, Texas, Kentucky, DC, Utah, Detroit, Chicago, all my niggas' worldwide

You come to fuck with one you fuckin' with all playa

All dem' niggas' in Anderson, Greenville, Spartanburg, Greenwood
Newberry, Columbia, South Carolina baby

They didn't want us to do it like this, we did it anyway
Ha ha ha........
