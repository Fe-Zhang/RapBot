[Godemis]
Nose full of Katy Perry, rollin', ridin' shotgun
Actin' like, I ain't got sense, cause I ain't got none
No religious bitches in my circle; I ain't got nun
Gotta leave a crater in this game before the clock's done

[Ubiquitous]
Now watch where we're headed, taking shots, come and get it
Hip hop menace, some say we never should have got breaded
Let it fly, moving through the sky, losing sight of us
My predecessors accepting my destiny's Midas touch

[Godemis]
Mouth stuffed with ecstasy in a state of Nirvana
With a belly full of molly I'm puffing this marijuana
I am on a - 'nother one, I am honored your honor honestly
The way they hate on Godi and Ubi is fucking comedy

[Ubiquitous]
The combination so uncommon, a cause, a company
To covet me and cover my cost, cousin now come at me
My blood's, running I'm one-hundred no matter what it seem
I've done nothing but crush whatever the fuck was in front of me

[Godemis]
Sh-sh-shot pictures, flicking pics, yeah we're on some sicker shit
Shooting up, with the reverend he's a flipping hypocrite
Bathing in the bath salt, loofah made of entrails
Seems to be I die in every other role like Denzel

[Ubiquitous]
U-B-I, suicide, diving while they shoot at me
You and I, Cru is unified, minor scrutiny
Suit and tie, execute a trooper sign of mutiny
Doing time, humans euthanized by the truth in me

[Godemis]
Okay, I'm zoned out, turnt up, wilding out, wavy
Rolling up the purple, bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby"
Working for no money isn't funny, it is slavery
I'm headed for oblivion and can't nobody save me

[Ubiquitous]
Pl-Planetary collision inner-vision apocalypse
Demonology, monetary toppled metropolis
Inequality, military coddle the populous
Mephistopheles headed full-throttle for opulence!

[Godemis]
Corner offices, sexy secretaries and e-mails
Demonic packages are delivered minus the details
Three rails later I pop it without a second look
This roll is for a chick and this carnage is for the record book

[Ubiquitous]
Tell my mama I'm sorry my job is so obnoxious
Body full of toxins I probably will never process
Paradigm shifting, stiffen up, catch a witch's ride
Wish that I would switch it up different, but why simplify?

[Godemis]
Too fly, launchpad, crash land, I'ma wreck it
Looking for the black box; FBI search method
Soul of Saddam, I'm the motherfucking bomb, check it
Inspiration of Hitler, Bruce Lee's work ethic

[Ubiquitous]
Sun Tzu manifested, Dali Lama mindstate
Hijack a G6, tripping, trying to fly straight
Spun a lie, I wonder why they wonder why I'm irate
Violation summon my emotion, I annihilate!

[Godemis]
Buy the bait, get 'em to bite and I might come buy the weight
Soon as we start eating these suckers are gonna try to hate
I relate, hard to see people do better than you
Strangers form a line outside hours 'fore we open the venue

[Ubiquitous]
Let me continue, feel the bad vibe calling I might could dial it back
Motherfuck a rapper talking 'bout I want my style back
Punks ice grilling me, I smile back, I relax
Hired for my prior stats, why attack? Fire back!

[Godemis]
Tires, flat-footing it, pure fuckery; I am that
People think this shit's a result of me smoking fire crack
Fade to black, freebasing in the back of a ratty shack
Killer City, miseryâ€™s one hell of a habitat

[Ubiquitous]
Well what's been happening? Now they asking me what got into me
Galvanize the lives of whoever's in my proximity
Lock, stock artillery, cock and aim at the industry
Paint a picture of pain and pleasure inside a symphony

[Godemis]
We got the chemistry on a struggle for constant energy
My aura's looking more like the color of what a killer's be
Killa beat, nothing to fornicate with a killer bee
The pen and pad's the remedy for whatever is illing me

[(Godemis) and Ubiquitous]
Philistines, lurking in silhouettes get the guillotine
(Stomping out your daymares, then we coming to kill a dream)
Snap awake, (activate), all civilians evacuate
(Back-back away), pack a 9, (sacrifices we had to make)
Strapped for time, (apex predator about to gravitate, back to shine) )
Fall out of place I'mma put 'em back in line
(Back inside of my lane), fraternizing with fame
(I shoot it rapid fire at your brain), we masterminding the game... ha!
