[Intro]
Dedicated to all the crews who said that Id never amount to nothing
To all the people who live next the train yard in Macleod and Eltham
Who called the police on me when I was just trying to paint a panel
To feed my ego
And all the writers out on Hursty line, go on spraying
It's all good out in Hursty

[Verse 1]
It was all a dream
I used to be amazed by the hip hop scene
AKA and DMA up in Hype Magazine
Graff photos on the wall
Every Saturday stepping to the AM Cruzy taking calls
I let my tape rock while waiting for pot
Smoke weed in al frescos, chilling round the local shops
Way back, when I always seem to have a marker dacked
And the trains are really trashed
Remember USA crew, and Jolimont yards
I never thought Melbourne crews could leave the trains so scarred
Wanna get my tag right, bag packed tight
Whipping out my spray, get up on the subway
Transit pressure, strip search
Dont let it stress ya
Check ya backpack, hoping that they can arrest ya
Peace to MD, pudgy, JME
Watsonia, Heidelberg to Montmorency
Writers getting up but they knew they should
Painting trains, same city, same hood, was all good

[Chorus]
It's all good
And if you don't know, if you don't know
If you don't know "Represent Hursty"
"Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"

[Verse 2]
I'd made the change from doing graff on streets
To up in PBS busting raps over beats
It was far from sweet
I smoked bongs with my mates all day
The bong breath kept the girls away
What these rappers used to say got me shitty
So I got busy
Now they wanna backstab and diss me
I always knew it could happen, this rapping stuff
I got busted twice for graff and racking stuff
And its funny how we both spent those days being the most
From 87, 88 that shit was dope
Whole cars, I'm dreaming. Train yards, I creep
Bags full of paint stashed inside a train seat
Racking all the fresh gear
Getting new clothes everyday of every year
A young kid
Acting cool after school being a fool
Catching blue trains on Hursty line
Pieced by pest and jewel
Getting hyped, a teenage graff writer, misunderstood
Greensborough neighborhood

[Chorus]
It's all good
And if you don't know, if you don't know
If you don't know "Represent Hursty"
"Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"

[Verse 3]
No ticket inspectors, or cameras on the fence
From the age of 13, with a marker represent
20mm super flow pen, or the posca
Got 2 empty middle cars, about to bomb yah
Tempra markers, 30mm fat
Hang out of Hitachi, bomb, do panels at the back
At the paint store, browsing
Wait for the right moment
Dack 3 cans and I'm bouncing
Thinking back on all the good paint racks
Getting chased by the jacks
Along the train tracks
Doing graff was like a sport, of course
No smile on my face the day I walked into court
Transit force, used to bust and raid us
Gave us $1000 fines that we payed up
In those days, when the smoke blazed
Never want to get a can of paint and go spray
Damn right, I like the life I live
Growing up on the line known as Hurstbridge

[Chorus]
It's all good
And if you don't know, if you don't know
If you don't know "Represent Hursty"
"Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
"Represent Hursty" "Borough to Eltham"
