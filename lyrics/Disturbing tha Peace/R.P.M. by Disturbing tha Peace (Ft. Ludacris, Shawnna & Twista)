[Shawnna]
Shawnna, kick hot shit for bitches
That got they baby daddies locked in the pen gone
Fittin' to rot, cause he did wrong, run up on the cops
And he hit 'em with the Glock, left his wig home
Sellin' rock on the big phone
In the projects, niggas run up on your set
With the tech' out, leave you wet with your chest out
Killer niggas, realer niggas, have a nigga
Feel a never realer nigga
Drill a nigga, fuckin' with a villain, never spill a nigga
Fuck that! Nigga bust back
We in the 'Lac, me and my bitches all strapped
Puffin the sack, and we be sippin on 'gnac
Fittin to react, and pop a nigga for them stacks (OOH-OOOH!)
Niggas I'm with, they put the fifth to your whole melon
I'm with the murderers and known felons
I gotta pop a nigga, drop a nigga, rock a nigga
Shock a nigga, lock a nigga, fuck a nigga, cop the floppin' nigga
Roll for my bitches, that be droppin' in the strip clubs
Tryin' get 'em a lil' somethin'
If you gotta take it off, take it off like a boss
For the big ones, then you get you a big gun
Motherfuckers in the Chi', like to put it yo' eye
If it's on, bitch, put it straight to you, don't miss
Now you fuckin' with them gangsters, ballers, hoes
Hustlers, bangers, niggas that with them real motherfuckers
Like whoa!

[Hook: Ludacris]
It's real real, on the block I been up for days
I gotta keep the steel steel in case a nigga wanna get in the way
So now what's the deal deal? On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)
Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!)
It's real real on the block, I been up for days
I gotta keep the steel steel in case a nigga wanna get in the way
So now what's the deal deal? On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)
Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!)

[Twista]
Twista kick hot shit for hoes and thugs
In ghettoes and clubs that get crunk;
For my homies locked down to whoever hurtin
In the hood and ballers with 22s on big trucks
To my thugs that call over to they mob
And to the hustlers that be servin hydro and cocaine
To my niggas that ain't hoes; if they have to
They will steal a nigga, touch a nigga, check a nigga, cut a nigga
Pull the trigger, bust a nigga, yellow motherfucker, nigga
Ready to fill and spill a drink, I'm drunk, go and weed it up
And I'm talkin about go like I'm smokin the bone
Full of some shit that damn sho' wouldn't seed it up
Got you feelin the Holy Ghost through your body
Probably reanimated with all my Legit Ballaz rollin up
Up the streets stuffed the beats
So you see them Navigators, Escalades, Benzes
Beamers, Excursions, bumpin systems
TVs and them twenties spinnin
Mob for them niggas that done came up off them hard times
K-Town, Westside, Southside
Murder us for the money
That's why I'm known to kick a hard rhyme
Whatever set you represent throw it up
If you buck or crunk then take yo' motherfuckin shirt off
Dealers get your work off; you wanna party
Full of hustle niggas killer niggas gangsta niggas chill niggas
Baller niggas thug niggas player haters real niggas

[Shawnna]
I'ma kick hot shit for bitches up in the industry
Tryin to compete with me
I'm from the hood, Southside, Westside
Where niggas'll put a motherfuckin slug in my enemy
Motown, Pucktown, do or die
The difference between a motherfuckin thug and a gangsta
One's thug in a chamber, get a nigga, stick a nigga
Put him in a ditch and then forget a nigga
Hit a nigga, pop a nigga, little with the rocket, nigga
Puff, pass, say you love that
We in the 'Llac and put the lemon in the 'gnac
Remy and sacks that got me scummy in the back
Puffin the raps that got me layin out slacks
And it's speakin like, "Wow, that, blunt let me hit the weed"
Cause I been feelin like, fuck a nigga, bust a nigga
Shawnna never love a nigga
Chi about to show the motherfuckers how to rush a nigga
Crush that, put it on momma
On everything I got a thang for the drama, puff marijuana
To things Shawnna gonna throw it on ya
Flows leave you froze in a coma
We so relentless, you know Chi gone bring the business
Blows to yo' dome in an instance
Home of them Folks and the mos and the kings and the 4s
And the BDs and lows and the fiends and the hoes
And, God!
