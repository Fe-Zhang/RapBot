[Verse 1: Shawnna]
Shit, Got a nigga gone off a fifth of Fayo and apple juice
Throw up a deuce, keep my hat banged to the left
And ain't scared to act a fool
So what you gone do, you betta not speak unless spoken to
Cause I bust that shiddit
Dump that Philly, I could back dro with a lac with a 'gnac
Gettin drunk off in it
Through the Chi like North, North, South, South
Niggas talk shit put that work in they mouth
In the East, East, West, West
Niggas bust back put a slug in ya chest
Cause I'm hood, hood, gutter, gutter
Shauna got juice like a muh'fucka
Hood of the hustlers and blood-suckers
Back in the bricks wit that good

Yep, in the spot, buyin yak wit my balla camp
All them bitches holla'n bout is (Where them fuckin dollas at)
Yeah, I got them hoes, I got them Os
I got Air phones for those hoes
And yeah, I got white phones, got black phones
I got crack, weed in the floor
So get on the grind, get on some lime
Get on mine, let ya mind take course
Got dip in the ride, switchin the tires
Whippin the fire 85 Chevy Sport
See if you got 16's, I will make that pliz'ay
And I'm dressed like a dope boy, throwin up them triz'eys

[Verse 3: I-20]
East side, whole Masterfield rainbow
Flight soles, kinda roll where them thangs blow
Good wood, not wastin that payroll
Five hoes trapped, boys got rapers
My size got air nigga rep that
We ride, rock sells and I bet that
Car is a gutless, pistol is a must bitch
Let a nigga know that his head I will bust quick
Some slum niggas know what I'm talkin bout
Lil rob fillin hoes in the parkin lot
Gimme head while I'm bustin that two track
It was trill, hit the fence, never looked back
Big thug, hit clubs in the fifth book
Dollar Boy, let em know how to rip folk
If a bitch broke, gotta let her slide, though
2-0 represent East side ho

[Verse 3: Lil' Fate]
Hell, I'm up in the club, 4 whippin up
Just throwin up pitch forks to (what, what)
2Pac, I'm a rider, hoppin out, Gangsta crip disciples (Yeeah!)
Wilin on the side of the club and dressed in blood colors
Waitin on a sign to (Yeeah!)
Pull out the gats and attack on them boys
That thought that (they thought it couldn't happen)
They blastin and screamin, we ain't friends
Ain't no need to pretend (Shawty!) Split them ends
For my homey that got killed last weekend
His brains was left leakin while his body got cold
Now it's y'all life that y'all owe
Time to even the score, case closed
