[Intro: B.O.W.]
Freestyler, rock the microphone
Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler, rock the microphone
Carry on with the freestyler

[Verse 1: B.O.W.]
I got to throw on and go on
You know I got to flow on, selectors on ya, radio play us
Cause we're friendly for ozone but that's not all so hold on
Tight as I rock the mic right, oh, excuse me, pardon
As I synchronize with the analysed upcoming vibes
The session, let there be a lesson, question
You carry protection or will your heart go on
Like Celine Dion, Karma Chameleon

[Chorus: B.O.W.]
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone

[Verse 2: B.O.W.]
Styles, steelos, we bring many kilos
So you could pick yours, from the various
Ambitious, nutritious, delicious, delirious or vicious
Just tell us, we deliver anything
From acappellas to best sellers, suckers get jealous
But they're soft like marshmallows, you know they can't handle us
Like Debbie does Dallas, yeah, we come scandalous
So who the fuck is Alice, she from the Buckingham Palace?

[Chorus: B.O.W.]
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone

[Bridge: B.O.W.]
Freestyler, rock the microphone
Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler, rock the microphone
Carry on with the freestyler

[Chorus: B.O.W.]
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock-rock, rock-rock, rock the microphone
