[Verse 1: Ives Irie]
Checkin' in from the left coast where we take sound
That combines sunshine with rhyme and move around
We take it slow, watch the smoke we blow
Bringing California swing in this thing fa sho
Well hey there babydoll dance the go go
Off a little mentally, I see it in slow mo
Hollywood the East side, Hub City to 'Frisco
Calles to the playa, fiyas up in the disco
Wooh oh woh now here we go
Mira Delinquentes bum rush the show
Aqui in Cali where trees so sweet
And these habits is feeling irie on this Ruck P beat
And on summer nights we move our feet
Keeping in mind the danger walking on these L.A. streets
So with eyes that reflect as the waves hit shore
And through the smoke of the green you seen burn next door
And where the birds sing but they don't tell the truth no more
And the streets hot, so truth is, better lock your door

[Hook]
Days is hot, nights get hotter
Fathers better watch your daughters
Days get longer, nights get shorter
Remember the police got quotas
City of Angels
Here even Angels watch they angles
Living in California
Showing nothing but love
Bringing peace when the push turn shove

[Verse 2: Kemo The Blaxican + Sen Dog]
Now you can bury me out in the back
El Californio
Right beside a cactus plant
Damn right sporting some corn rolls
I be the vato with the bomb ass green
From the left coast
Seny sosa, out here living fresco
All is good From the ready and a set go
But if you illing, I’m dropping that left bro
South Gate, California what it's all about homies
From the hill is who I’m shouting out
We all O.G.'s, Veteranos
Putting work in for a chingo de anos
And it don’t ease up or slow down
Still getting money when we come around
You know what’s up we delinquente
Twenty five years I been familia with these gente
Check me out on they new LP
Tequila and shots and the jetfuel trees
Ragtop down on a 63’
Glock 17 and the ocean breeze

[Hook]
Days is hot, nights get hotter
Fathers better watch your daughters
Days get longer, nights get shorter
Remember the police got quotas
City of Angels
Here even Angels watch they angles
Living in California
Showing nothing but love
Bringing peace when the push turn shove

[Verse 3: Ives Irie]
These days the sea shore I see a little bit more
But I still love botella reflections plus more
I love breeze, long laughs, guitar chords, old blues, reggae too
Click clack of skateboards
What's that that's making me feel this hardcore
From the land of the hip hop that y'all gon' starve for
Bob your head so hard you'll wreck your car for
I like money, but your love and respect is far more

[Verse 3: Kemo The Blaxican]
Asi lo es sur califa, te aplacan a prisa
Saliendo de la barra o saliendo de misa
Put’em down; no frown, deja ver la sonrisa
No beef in the party but I’m killing the pista
From the underground so I'm turning the milpa
Re-ignite the whole scene cause I’m bringing the chispa
Been around the world pero aqui mero rifa
Deeply rooted right here tu sabes en Califa

[Hook]
Days is hot, nights get hotter
Fathers better watch your daughters
Days get longer, nights get shorter
Remember the police got quotas
City of Angels
Here even Angels watch they angles
Living in California
Showing nothing but love
Bringing peace when the push turn shove
