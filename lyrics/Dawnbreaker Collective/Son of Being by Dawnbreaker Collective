Come on!
Let's go!
Hands up!
Stand up!
There's no turning back!

Come up with me
Take heavenly
Remember me
O Son of Spirit

Ziggy ziggy ziggy ziggy zugar
The whole world getting rolled like a Cuban cigar
New order will replace that
Switch it like a place mat
Angel tells the devil "Do you want to spar?"
The world fades to black, you can't take it back
The world is going to fade
What you gotta say to that?
You're a player, well you can't play with that
We living in a world, so we gotta pay the tax
Inny, minny, miny, moe yo I gotta go
It's like hopscotch, well I hoping over obstacles
I don't know, it's like the world is just a pothole
Won't fall in, I swerve and burn like a hot coal
I'm told the weather's cold but don't stick
Cause it can turn around and straight burn like a hostile
So think quicker and brother don't slip up
This place won't last so you better take a picture

Oh! Oh Son of Being
Make mention of Me
Remember Me
Remember Me
Oh! Oh Son of Being
Make mention of Me
On My earth and in My heaven I may remember thee

Come y'all, say a little prayer for I
When the sky turns dark and the angels cry
And the tears fall down and the ground is soft
And the world is an ocean, I'm just a drop
In the ways of the wicked is the path I walk
Got a grip like death, every righteous thought
Though I sleep just a little bit, won't get caught
Trying to lick pure light, it's diving in art
On a bus, on a train, on a car, on a plane
When it all crash down, who you got to blame?
It gets real when I say "God don't play games"
In a world full of brothers like Cable and Ain
Don't change cause it never really did make sense
Only thing that I got is the time I spent
Got faith like a rock and I won't repent
Cause the Ridvan of love is my heavenly bliss

Oh! Oh Son of Being
Make mention of Me
Remember Me
Remember Me
Oh! Oh Son of Being
Make mention of Me
On My earth and in My heaven I may remember thee

Cause the sun came around, almost had me down
15 candles, blow 'em out now, now
Law, are you ready steady head toward the east
The Prince of Peace, declare your belief
Teach, try to reach, each and every one
A faithful son, but doubt weighs a ton
Concrete to my knees, can't freeze, tag, go
8000 miles on the hope is I'm told
Docked in the horror, got lost in the globe
Under star gates, I serve the Threshold
With bombs that go boom, and wars that don't rest
A young American boy toying with death
Gave God a look, broke the prayer book
The Shaykh said we got a hook from God's right
In the middle of a mountain, a fountain of light
In between 19 Carmel's delight
Suddenly serenity
The plan of God's calamity
The Tablet of Ahmad came to me
Certitude set me free

Oh! Oh Son of Being
Make mention of Me
Remember Me
Remember Me
Oh! Oh Son of Being
Make mention of Me
On My earth and in My heaven I may remember thee

Oh! Oh! Oh! Ya! Come on!  Hands Up!
Whole world
Far East
Far West
Up North
Down South
This is it y'all
No turning back
Stand up
Get up
Rise up
Come on
