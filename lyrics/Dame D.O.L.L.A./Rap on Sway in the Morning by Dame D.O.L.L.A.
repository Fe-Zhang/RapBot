[Verse]
Me being the chosen one was like a blessing interception
City known for homicide, majority depression
Grinding in the gym so I could live through the recession
Real goons show me love 'cause they can feel how I’m connected
Background of a street dude, mind of a scholar
Just to pop our collar, man, we climbing for the dollar
I mean it when I say it, bruh, we started from the bottom
Childhood friends dropping like leaves and it’s autumn
Don’t believe time is money, money is time
When you focused, man, you look up and your money is fine
I’m from a city where your friend will put a gun to your mind
'Cause you eating and they envy all that glory and shine
I swear to God it gets realer, a city full of killers
Addicts walking 'round looking like the zombies off of “Thriller”
It’s sick and getting iller that’s why my skin thicker
Now you see why brothers want to get away, grab a Snicker
My mission took me to college where I picked up the knowledge
And tried to stay away from violence since I escaped the virus
Divided my folks from tyrants, but I rised from that  environment
In my life it was perfect timing, and my drive blew me up, atomic
I’m sick of these suckers all in my bubble, though
Critiquing me on stuff I had to struggle for
This dream done been a long time coming
And my clock was Forrest Gump—it spent a long time running
