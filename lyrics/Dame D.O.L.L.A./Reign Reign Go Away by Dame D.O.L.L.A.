[Intro]
D.O.L.L.A

[Verse]
He say he the GOAT, I come for his body
Platinum 'cause he bought the copies
Should've just passed me the torch
I got no remorse, I beat him like Rocky
I fill the tank up with Diesel
You jealous of me and I see you
'Cause on this day, originals just can't fuck with the sequel
I'm new school, got new hits
Space Jams, not Blue Chips
Hangman, yo' shoe's shit
Dame 6, I'm too lit
Big name, got big bread, but you corny
Gift bags get purchased every time you get horny, then they repo'd
Loved you when you was in beast mode
Lowkey thought you was a cheat code
Know that you shoot for the cheap hoes
Shooting need work like your free throws
Know you see my pockets deep so
Your flexing ain't really your thing bro
We both could be working at Kinko's
And Kobe won you them rings though
Ole nursery rhyme spittin', small car sittin'
Ole Icy Hot poster boy, TNT snitchin'
You big man hatin', mad at my existence
Had a song with Bad Boy
Well I'm Jordan to the Pistons
Still getting to the chicken
This ain't nothing new to me
I've always been the chosen one
Nothing you could do with me
This what Rich look like, before the dough and jewelry
I'm from where Tom Hanks from, but no tomfoolery
Do it for the fam, ain't no Magic, no Kazaam
Ain't no flexin' for the gram, I'm for real
I promise you don't really wanna meddle/mettle with me, Steel
All yo' personalities, real characters could get revealed
We could've did a track together, just pass the torch
It's lit without you brother, I was bussing off the porch
Call 9-11, ha, dusting off the Porsche
Look inside that statue at Staples and find a corpse
Confused at why you barked up the tree, 'cause I'ma do ya
Versace on my body, you finally gon' meet Medusa
Don't know if I address you as Shaq, or Shaq-Fool-Ya
Old head can't see me, he blinded, Slick Rick The Ruler
Pride all in the way and you know it, you big cocky
Heard my rhymes and quickly turned into a diss jockey
Nigga wanna play with the monster, you Big Papi
Was mad at Steph's Unanimous trophy, you sick probably
It'd be wise to move on Aristotle 'cause this a gimme
All the money in the world, but traded you for Penny
Recorded with the legends of your time, I get with plenty
Never run from smoke, I'm the type to climb up the chimney
Was really feeling threatened, at least enough to diss me
Should've knew this was a shootout, I could never let you zip me
Said that max was little, that 250 million crispy
Can't recall you getting that when I was cruising on the 10 speed
This a different era, you the past and you the past
Said yourself that I'm a Tesla, no longer need diesel gas
Kinda like the Cavs ain't really need Diesel ass
And even in Miami, won that on the strength of Flash
You had a moment OG, you the pioneer
But I done reached the top at this point and the climb is clear
All my bars is colder than any climate that's near
So if you looking for the stop to the reign you could find it here
Feel me!
