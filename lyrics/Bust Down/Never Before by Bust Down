Trap House cops pulling up
Hide the drugs
Hide the drugs
Yeah, aye

(CHORUS)
I just ran up 2 checks no cap
Copped a new Rolls Royce no cap (x4)

(Verse 1)
Zo6 ya we ride around
It like six for a pound now
Act like a kid on the playground
From the 6 going westbound
Foreign Whip ya it's blacked out
Stacking bricks we still in pound
Caught with a stick my whip impound
And your bitch is in the background
Don't know if you know
Sit at home all alone
Use me for my money you betrayed
I'm bigger while you're smaller you deflate
I spend a million on estates
Take you out now my past is erased
No, I'm not going back I ain't afraid
Cops try to catch up I evade

(Chorus)
I just ran up 2 checks no cap
Copped a new Rolls Royce no cap (x3)

(Verse 2)
I been grinding yeah I'm never late
Why the fuck you crying over dates
No hoes man my life is great
All the bitches ever do is hate
Haven't heard a single one that stayed
All they ever wanna do is fake
I'm just stacking cheese up on my plate
I'm just pouring lane in my plane
Midnight, you still out
In insight, you see doubt
See doubt
Yeah you running quick talking shit
When we move away there is no calling sick
All the way we've betting licks another zip
I'm the wave don't fall for it don't fall for it

(Chorus)
I just ran up 2 checks no cap
Copped a new Rolls Royce no cap (x4)

(Verse 3)
You can't see me calling up
Never see me fall in love
Never see me make a rush
Never see me take the bus
I ain't never had no crush
All I ever I hear is buzz
All you ever do is tuss
All I ever do is rough
Going down like a flush
I am never what you was
Talking about another stuff
Like a phone, I had a plus
Moving past you like a brush
Moving past you like a brush
I spent a million on estates
I found a Millie in the states
You too skinny get a weight
I'm too busy gotta wait
I live in the city with the gates
I live in the city with the gates
I make a million like bill gates
Living in the city with the gates

(Chorus)
I just ran up 2 checks no cap
Copped a new Rolls Royce no cap (x4)

(Outro)
I'm trapping I'm running it up
I'm definitely falling in love
I can't see what I got for dove
I cancel it with like one shove
I cancel it with like one shove
I can't sit with you I'm above
Yeah I'm above yeah I'm above ya
