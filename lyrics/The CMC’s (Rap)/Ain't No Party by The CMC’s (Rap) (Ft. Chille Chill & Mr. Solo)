Whoo yeah
Don't miss this party {*5X*}

[Mr. Solo - Gospel Gangstaz]
It's not the beat that gets me off my feet
I can't sit this out, its the praise in my mouth, I gotta get it out
I keep the Son number one when I come with my gun and I'm all up in ya ears like
Drum come along, come a long, sing along, bring along ya crew
Roll wit me, stroll wit me, now come and go wit me
To a spot where its hot and the party never stops
No hemmy on the rocks, no boots gettin knocked
This is strictly for the Born Again, Baptized Believas
No more party at the party cause its in the Name of Jesus
No end-o, no 40-0s, just the homies from the clique and the Holy Ghost
They won't bury me, when the sweet chariot swings low and carry me
I'm shoutin for joy like I was Gary B
Silly of you to ask but don't pronder
And if you ain't knowin I'm a goin over yonder
And if you think the partys in the basement then you a silly racket
Saved on the top floor where the partys really at (??)
The CMC's and O Double G's, the Gangsta Christian Clique
If you ain't at the party then you missin it

Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
It keeps kickin like karate
Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
You better ask everybody

[Mr. Solo - Gospel Gangstaz]
The partys on the Cross, it won't cost ya
Tryin to make peace wit bad beats then ill toss ya
Oh I thought we lost ya, but I see ya frown now
As I bow down, Daddy Free would you grab the mic and clown now

[Daddy Free]
Straight word out my mouth, G O D is turnin out
He's comin back again and thats something I can shout about
So let the party begin, let me in
Or I'm kickin down the door, comin through the floor
Or down through the ceiling like James I got the feeling
There's a way, I'm almost willin, I gots to get my healin
Revealin, so applealin, I gots to make racket
You couldn't stop me from praisin with a straight jacket
There's a party goin on, let me make this clear
Bonnavision never seen nuttin like this here (??)
Annointing thick, angels in the midst
Yokes gettin broke and now the demons gettin pissed
They tellin me to stop but please save it
Cause I'm on dance out my clothes like I'm David
The partys back wit it, full of cold jenks and Baptists (??)
Word to fake Catholics, sayin music carismatics
Blacks, latinos, Cabreans and Europeans
Comin in the pair like Noah from Salmoa
CMC's straight knowin it
There's a party goin on and the Spirirt of Grace is throwin it
So pray you get a Holy Ghost letter
Cause ain't no, can't nobody do it better

Don't miss this party
In the L O R D
Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
You better ask everybody
Don't miss this party
In the L O R D
Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
It keeps kickin like karate
Don't miss this party
In the L O R D
Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
So please tell 'em what takes place

[Chille Chill - Gospel Gangstaz]
It's a holy Ghost party, so come on get ya praise on
And ya groove on, if not that move on
Cause I'm on praise Jesus till I dizzie
And when He comes back and part this skizzy
Before I go to Heaven man
Three sixty-five, seven twenty-four man
This is a party on Holy Ground
So let ya praises go up, and ya blessins come down
And stop actin like ya tired a sumpn
So won't you get off you seat and get your blessins while this music is bumpin and thumpin
I see the party, people jumpin, screamin "party over here, party over there"
Praisin God is what we about, CMC's, Holy Terra, and we out

And it ain't no party
Don't miss this party
In the L O R D
Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
It keeps kickin like karate
Don't miss this party

Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party

Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
You better ask everybody
Don't miss this party

Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
It keeps kickin like a donkey

Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party

Ain't no party like a Holy Ghost party
