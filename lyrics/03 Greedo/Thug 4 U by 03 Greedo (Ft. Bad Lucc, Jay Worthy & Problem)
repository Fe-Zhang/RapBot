[Intro: Problem]
Do you think we need one more?
You think we need one more
Alright, we'll get one more
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus: Problem]
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two
You might be around a plug or two
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a Blood or two
You might be around a Cuz or two

[Verse 1: Problem]
Have you drippin' 'fore I kiss it (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Come hit a mission with a nigga (Ooh, ah, ooh)
FaceTime me while you rub it (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Mama's boy, but I be thuggin' (And I really, really love it)
Gotta get the bag, ayy, get the bag, keep a bag
Ain't comin' home by eight, but I for sure make sure you straight
Shit ain't nothin' like she dated, man, a real one coming over
Shit get hectic, hit my line, guess who comin' with the blower?
Boo, you good? (What?)

[Chorus: Problem]
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two (Yes)
You might be around a plug or two (Yes)
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you (That's what's up)
You might be around a Blood or two
You might be around a Cuz or two

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Baby, let me put some thug in you
Know I'm high, so let a nigga put some drugs in you
She a square, but she be fuckin' with the drug dealers
Plus I heard her daddy was a plug, so I stuck with her
I put that molly in my mud when I fuck with her
She slow it down and speed it up, I fell in love with her
Ain't eat it out, I beat it up, she expectin' me to cuff
Ho, I'm nothing like your man, I'm too much realer
Won't trick, but I got you
You just my lil' partner
And fuck what they say
These people just pop it

[Chorus: Problem]
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you (Yes)
You might be around a thug or two (Yes)
You might be around a plug or two
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a Blood or two
You might be around a Cuz or two

[Verse 3: Jay Worthy]
Had to remind her like you know who you fuckin' with? (It's P Worthy)
Mister international, bitch, you still on Fig (You on the blade)
John Bo on a ho, what the fuck is big? (What is that?)
I do it gigantic, my pimpin' titanic
Bitch, I been braggin' (Woah), ain't shit happenin' (Woah)
With your funky ass (Funky bitch)
Them square niggas you was fuckin' with might let it pass
Only time I'm pullin' up is to collect my trap (Some money)
If I'm getting out of bed, better be some cash (Facts)

[Verse 4: Bad Lucc]
Put my Filas on (Huh)
I spent a hundred thousand just in Regal chrome (Shit)
Sittin' on the Vogues, daddy lookin' like a beast
Sittin' on the Vogues, daddy lookin' like a beast
Baby say she like it when I flex on her (Yeah)
Fuckin' with the yacht, I blew a check on her
Told the homies she my bitch, and I'ma keep it cool
Nigga out of line, I'ma do the fool (Yes)

[Chorus: Problem]
Baby, let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two
You might be around a plug or two (That's what's up)

[Outro: Problem]
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh
