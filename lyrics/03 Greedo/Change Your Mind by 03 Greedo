[Intro]
Yeah
If you ever
If you ever change (Your mind)
Change your mind (If you, if you)
Yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
If you ever change your mind
Bitch, use your brain
Go get that change
Used to be a friend of mine
Now everything changed
And I'm tryna maintain
If you ever change your mind
Bitch, use your brain
Go get that change, yeah
Used to be a friend of mine
Now everything changed
I'm just tryna maintain

[Post-Chorus]
I was tryna get change
'Til a nigga got chained
Now I'm losin' my brain
You should stay in your lane
You should sell some cocaine
Don't give up that bullshit
If you give it up, better not be no rookie
Go get the money
Ooh, don't get your shit tooken
Told you to ride, keep it gangster
I showed you how to shoot that banger
Showed you how to carry that chopper
Now you ridin' with a gun, thug

[Chorus]
If you ever change your mind
Bitch, use your brain
Go get that change
Used to be a friend of mine
Now everything changed
And I'm tryna maintain
If you ever change your mind
Bitch, use your brain
Go get that change, yeah
Used to be a friend of mine
Now everything changed
I'm just tryna maintain

[Post-Chorus]
I was tryna get change
'Til a nigga got chained
Now I'm losin' my brain
You should stay in your lane
You should sell some cocaine
Don't give up that bullshit
If you give it up, better not be no rookie
Go get the money
Ooh, don't get your shit tooken
Told you to ride, keep it gangster
I showed you how to shoot that banger
Showed you how to carry that chopper
Now you ridin' with a gun, thug

[Chorus]
