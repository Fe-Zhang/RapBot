[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
Lately I been having these visions
Locked inside a cell with no windows
Hope I make it out of this prison
I'll be coming back with a vengeance
I'll be right back when I'm ready
When I get back, I'll be richer
Lately I been having these visions
Locked inside a cell with no windows
Lately I been having these visions, I'm out my mind
Lately I been having these visions, I'm out my mind, yeah

[Verse]
Peep guns in the lot, peep guns on the yacht
This time they ain't ours, cousin locked behind bars
I done had a life that's hard, yeah
I done made it out the tar, yeah
I was stuck in the pavement, hey
While them peoples in the grave
So much shit we got away with
Make me wanna get saved
I been prayin' on my knees
Since they shot me in the leg
I been goin' through ups and downs
Off the uppers and downers, no seesaw
Tell me have you ever been in a ride
While trying your hardest not to sleepwalk?
Fuck all your promise, don't need one
I got the money on me
Fuck all your fake little Nina
I got someone who love me, hey

[Chorus]
Lately I been having these visions
Locked inside a cell with no windows
Hope I make it out of this prison
I'll be coming back with a vengeance
I'll be right back when I'm ready
When I get back, I'll be richer
Lately I been having these visions
Locked inside a cell with no windows
Lately I been having these visions, I'm out my mind
Lately I been having these visions, I'm out my mind, yeah

Your current balance is 46 dollars, 64 cents
This call is from a corrections facility and is subject to monitoring and recording
Yes sir, 03 live from C12, right here in the Texas jail, you feel me?
Been rockin' with DJ Mustard more than ten summers
I ain't never hated, I just waited
All that negativity ain't get a nigga nowhere
I ain't talkin' 'bout no positive shit
But gangbanging, no selling dope in my music
I'm talkin' 'bout the past life, you feel me?
When I get out I'ma be a millionaire, I came in here with nothin, feel me?
You ain't never got to cross no nigga to get where you're goin'
That ain't gon' do nothin' but get a nigga hurt
I'll be back sooner than May, they callin' it 20 on paper
But I'll be right back sooner than you think
You dig?
Ayy, that shit gonna be hard, niggas gonna be like, "This nigga a fool"
You tryna, you tryna hear some bars while you out here?
You tryna rap some shit?
