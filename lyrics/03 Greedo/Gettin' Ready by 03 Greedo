[Intro]
03
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus]
I bet she play this song when she put on her clothes
Turn up when she get ready, she can't come to the phone
Leave her alone
She single this evening
Her outfit came from England (Yeah)
Louis heels, red bottoms, no sneakers
Turn up when she get home

[Verse 1]
She say, "03, unzip me," I take that shit down
She say she miss me when I'm not around
Sometimes I feel like a worthless amount
But shit, I know you workin', we'll work this shit out
She say we makin' the hottest shit out
03 Greedy and Mustard the sauciest sound
Undressed, sittin' on top of the covers like, "I need it now"
Soon as I get in the house
She was gettin' ready for me, but I came early
Gotta bag her before my show, great performance
Twerk it like I'm thirsty, now she get a nigga horny
My lil' hottie thuggin' but she still be gettin' girly
Brought a hottie home for a nigga who be starvin'
Eat it like it's gourmet, this lil' bitch a foreign
You know my sweet lady dark skin, we recording
Lookin' like I got good taste, that's the way we doin' it

[Chorus]
I bet she play this song when she put on her clothes
Turn up when she get ready, she can't come to the phone
Leave her alone
She single this evening
Her outfit came from England
Louis heels, red bottoms, no sneakers
Turn up soon as she get home

[Verse 2]
She was in the shower for another half an hour
Skyscraper dick, standin' tall as Eiffel Tower
Say she stay in London, her name Paris, she be wildin'
English muffin in the mornin', I get dough, that why he's sour
I need kush and orange juice, turn me up, I'm blowin' power
Getting ready, I'm off ecstasy so I ain't really tired
Two days with the plug who do drugs, so I'm wired
Know you heard I got the fire, hit you with that Oscar Meyer
Chanel on her bag, I'm her secret admirer
I'm geekin' so I need you just like Stevie had his Myra
Ain't fuckin' with 12 but I feel family matters
We workin' on one on the low
We gettin' ready, relationships goals (Oh)
She gettin' ready
She gettin' ready (Already know)

[Chorus]
I bet she play this song when she put on her clothes
Turn up when she get ready, she can't come to the phone
She single this evening
Her outfit came from England
Louis heels, red bottoms, no sneakers
Turn up soon as she get home

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
On the low
Turn up when she get ready, she can't come to the phone
She single this evening
Her outfit came from England
Louie heels red bottom, no sneakers
Turn up soon as she get home
I bet she play this song when she gettin' ready
When she gettin' ready
