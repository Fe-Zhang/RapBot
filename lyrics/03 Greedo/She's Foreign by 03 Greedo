[Chorus]
She's, foreign
She call me at 3 in the morning
Call me 03 when she horny
She wanna speed in the foreign
She, warm, feet, warm
She pull up at 3 PM Sunday
Fuck her till 3 AM Monday
She's, foreign
She call me at 3 in the morning
She call me 03 when she horny
She wanna speed in the foreign
She, warm, feet, warm
She pull up at 3 PM Sunday
Fuck her till 3 AM Monday

[Verse 1]
Think I might make her my BM
She wanna Maybach and penis
She ain't gon play with the rim
She ain't gon stay with her friends
She don't wanna meet La vantre
Maserati truck ugly
She gon ride me like a Bentley
I might hit it , then I'm out ayy
She love everything about me
Cause you know I'm bout my business
Get your roll on, twist it
Pink diamond shades, back in
Money cause all that attraction
She gon ride for some attention
She gon crash in the back seat
Strap it up, for protection
I'm finna park in the middle of her intersection
I'm finna park in the middle of her intersection

[Refrain]
Foreign, She, warm, feet, warm

[Chorus]
She's, foreign
She call me at 3 in the morning
She call me 03 when she horny
She wanna speed in the foreign
She, warm, feet, warm
Pull up at 3 PM Sunday
Fuck her till 3 AM Monday
She's, foreign
Call me at 3 in the morning
She call me 03 when she horny
She wanna speed in the foreign
She, warm, feet, warm
She pull up at 3 PM Sunday
Fuck her till 3 AM Monday

[Verse 2]
She wanna marry me, told me to never divorce
She wanna ride a McLaren and ride in a Porsche
She wanna low Lamborghini, no fucking Ferrari
She wanna apple martini, I'm sipping on [?]
Laid back, I'm a young nigga
We was coolin, just vibin'
We was coolin, just right
[?] vibe
Just to let lil mama ride it
Suppose to be on her way home
We took a trip and she liked it
Now I can't leave her alone
Exit the freeway, I made a U-turn
Fuck what we thinking, you know we too gone
She's, foreign, She, warm
She got a body just like a Bugatti  [?]
We played a game of "how deep are your pockets?"
Whatever she want boy, she know that I got it
She my lil rider, she my lil rider
She my lil rider, she my lil rider

[Chorus]
She's, foreign
She call me at 3 in the morning
She call me 03 when she horny
She wanna speed in the foreign
She, warm, feet, warm
Pull up at 3 PM Sunday
Fuck her till 3 AM Monday
She's, foreign
Call me at 3 in the morning
She call me 03 when she horny
She wanna speed in the foreign
She, warm, feet, warm
She pull up at 3 PM Sunday
Fuck her till 3 AM Monday
