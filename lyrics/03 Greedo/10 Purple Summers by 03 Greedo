[Intro]
You know me out here, are you seeing?
Keep all lids on here, you dig?
Are you feeling me?
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus]
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife

[Verse 1]
Some of my niggas fuck twins, bareback and skins
My lil' homie in the pen, he got more than the ten
He been fuckin' on the enemies and hittin' his friends
Told his cousin where his stash at, she needed a flip
He don't even gang bang, thought she needed a Crip
She just needed some dick, he in visiting kids
While he missing all his kids, she's in bitches and dip
Politicking in the ghetto while his sis babysit
And she gon' give me respect, 'cause she know a nigga gangster
I'll shoot at her dad right inside where he at
Go and buy some baguettes, you can't buy your respect
Just got a backend and I bought me a TEC

[Chorus]
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife

[Verse 2]
This lil' hottie in the ghetto that my partner was fucking
Same little thottie that my partner was ducking
Shit was nice, she was bugging
I'm talking knuckin' and buckin'
But lil' mama know she wrong, 'cause she know she been fucking
And this bitch that I'm loving
And I'm wanted for saving
Fuck you niggas, we want it
Some fuck the PJs, some fuck in the Hummers
So I'm saying fuck the projects, let's go get this money (Ayy)
I do this shit for the money
You know I keep it one hundred
Bitch we too high to be dummies
We overthinking the subject
I'll disrespect you in public
Who got the pistol? We'll bust 'em
Who got the Glizzy? I want it
Ain't a nigga I'm trusting
Every time I do a show, you know my bitches be tussling
Baby, I'm the type of nigga that'll start a fight
You lucky you the type of bitch that's taught to swallow pipe
Guarantee this little bitch is finna fuck tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife

[Bridge]
I'm from the section where we save a bitch for no reason
We carry Glizzies in every season
Ooh, niggas ain't trapping, we thieving
My niggas is heathens
My niggas is demons

[Chorus]
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend wife
Ain't shit right
Baby, you know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
This that brick life, project brick life
Run off on your first plug, fuck your best friend's wife
Ain't shit right
You know that we livin' trife
