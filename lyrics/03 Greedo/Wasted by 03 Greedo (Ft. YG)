[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Every day we wanna meet hoes at the strip club
Bitches ain't showin' no pussy and shit
You know what I'm saying
How much this shit cost?
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
Nah, bitch, you just gon' show your nipples or something?
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
I only came outside the house with half a bag, ayy
How much it cost to get some brain while I lane switch?
Fuck you when you got the change, money ain't shit
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted
Fuck it, I'm wasted
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted
Fuck it, I'm wasted, ayy

[Verse 1: 03 Greedo]
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
How much it cost to bust it down like an AP?
She told me good pussy really worth the payment
I paid the cost, we go half on a baby
She tryna have a soul child, she half crazy
Bitch, there ain't no money, we can get it out the pavement
I ain't tryna trick ya, tryna put you on the slave ship
Get it out the zombie, so she workin' on the grave shift
Turn a trick, get that change on a late night
Suck this dick in a Range on a late night
Focus on the campaign on a late night
Stay awake off cocaine on a late night

[Chorus: 03 Greedo & YG]
How much it cost for me to see you half naked? (Naked)
I only came outside the house with half a bag, ayy (Bag, ayy)
How much it cost to get some brain while I lane switch? (Lane switch)
Fuck you when you got the change, money ain't shit (Ain't switch)
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted (Wasted)
Fuck it, I'm wasted (Wasted)
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted (How much it cost for you to... 4 hunnid)
Fuck it, I'm wasted

[Verse 2: YG]
Uh, how much it cost for you to fuck, bitch?
How much it cost for you to suck dick?
Ayy, that pussy smell like you been at the club, bitch
House in the hills, I got a tub, bitch
Wasted, notice I just fucked a fake bitch
What's fake about her? Her ass and tits
I ain't no leech, I ain't no bum, I ain't no fuckin' dummy
I'm tryna put this dick in your tummy
I don't believe her when she say she love me
Love is dead, lil' bitch, I ain't no fuckin' mummy
Wasted, gang shit, go at her chunky
Wasted, gang shit, the whole hood love me
YG got beat, the whole hood funky
YG the reason the whole hood totin'
Bla-da-da, laughin' to the bank, hahaha
These ain't off-brand, lil' mama, these Pra-da-das
I just wanna fuck, I don't ask for much
Yeah, I eat the pussy, I don't eat the butt
After I fuck, don't hold a grudge
I'ma hit it from the back, fuck up your lace fronts

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
How much it cost for me to see you half naked?
I only came outside the house with half a bag, ayy
How much it cost to get some brain while I lane switch?
Fuck you when you got the change, money ain't shit
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted
Fuck it, I'm wasted
Ayy, ayy, bitch wasted
Fuck it, I'm wasted, ayy
