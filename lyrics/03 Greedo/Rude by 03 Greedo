[Intro]
Ooh
03 (Joog)

[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude (Ayy)
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool (Ron-Ron, do that shit)
Lately, we been so out our minds (Beat Boy taught me)
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to be stressful
But my life been so hectic
I can't go nowhere without my own protection
These niggas think I need a shooter, boy, forget it
Ain't nobody shoot when I was strugglin' on crutches
They say I'm a ho 'cause they ain't coming to my functions
Everybody talk, but nobody be doing nothing
Every nigga 'round me, I can't really trust 'em
Ordered up a K to do some bustin'
I don't have time for a discussion
Drummer Gang beat it up, percussion
On Money, came into this rap game with my own money

[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds

[Verse 2]
Tryna tell me what to do made me not fuck with you
You ain't never made the news, you really just confused
Fuck your opinion, LA Weekly think that I'm that dude
That explains your attitude
Niggas start shit, then complain that I respond and don't stop it
Working out has never been an option
I'ma still talk shit, this ain't no act
I can't hit your double cup 'cause this ain't no Act
This ain't revolvers, these is some TECs
I don't trust this nigga, I just seen who he texts
Make a pussy nigga go and lean like some Tech
Used to snort cocaine, now I fiend for the check, yeah
Ooh
Ooh
I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude (Ayy)
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
I don't mean to be rude
I don't mean to be out of line
I been losing my cool
Lately, we been so out our minds
