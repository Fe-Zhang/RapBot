Get it poppin, every time she be poppin' up
Screaming "I want to fuck women" but don't pop it up

Slowly rolling, we loaded
Don't you ever leave me get lonely (Yeah, yeah)
And you know I'm fully loaded
Big old thing on my waist
All these girls love my drip
All these girls want this drip
Killing every drag on these niggas and it's over
This bitch no longer
Nigga, when it's over
I’m still game over
Beat it up, eat it up, like I’m 'posed to, yeah
One take, one take like Pro Tools
Can’t love you

These choppers loaded

[Verse 2]
I ain't ever liked a bully
Went from semis to the fullies
When a nigga lost his mind
I remember I was blind (Yeah)
I was living by the bullet
I remember all the bullshit
I remember central bookin’
I remember this bitch look good
All this noise in the room
I've been living in the room
I remember I was fooled
Now I'm dripping in the jewels
I been dripping all over you (All over you)
I been dripping all over you (I was dripping all over you)

[Chorus]
Loaded, I'm fully loaded
These choppers loaded
Yeah, loaded
Loaded, I'm fully loaded
These choppers loaded
Yeah, loaded

Loaded, reloaded (I be dripping all over you)

[Outro]
How much did your drip cost you?
'Cause I'm dripping all over you
Loaded, I'm fully loaded
