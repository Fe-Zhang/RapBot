[Intro]
I don't gamble, bitch
But I bet you this
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus]
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me
Just for every fuckboy that thought that he was shinin’ on me
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me
Just for every fuckboy that thought that he was shinin' on me
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me (Ayy, ayy)
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me (Bitch, bitch, ayy)

[Verse]
Keep all that, lil' bitch, I’m goin' in, it's off the top
Keep all that, I got them racks, I wanna fuckin' ball
Ayy, ayy, cheatin' on my wife
Ayy, ayy, almost got life
Six times, six times, spit six lines
Freestyle all time, I'm the hardest
FaceTimed with A Boogie, he say I'm the bigger artist
PnB Rock pulled up when I got my charges
I got friends in the rap game
I got friends in the trap game
I was bumpin' when you niggas had acne
Get it poppin’
Ayy, ayy, Diddy boppin’
Bitch, I think I'm P Diddy, I’m a superstar
Yeah, I'm pullin' up on you in a supercar
Soon as niggas let me outta that pen
I'm that nigga that just had to get it in
Bailed out back in 2016
2018, now I’m the king
You don't wanna fuck with me in the ring
You don't wanna fuck with me when I swing
I am, uh, buzzin', the bee
Ooh, sting like a bumblebee
Ayy, greatest like I'm Ali
Ayy, you can never chalk me
Glad I never got killed, bitch, I kept it real
Bitch, I'm doin' all my dance moves, I'm Johnny Gill
I'm just playin', I was talkin' 'bout that Bobby Brown
Ayy, and I'm fuckin' with that Whitney now
Rest in peace, rest in peace, I got the recipe
Why you think they call me Green G? You couldn't mess with me
Ayy, ayy, I'm fuckin' up the free
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm a fuckin' beast
Why the fuck you think they call me Gucci Wolf?
Pullin' up in the streets, I bought a Gucci book
Ayy, ayy, ooh, Gucci bookbag
Ayy, ayy, you thought I took that
Niggas be stealin' and scammin' (Ayy, ayy)
Ayy, I was sellin' them pills and them hammers
Ayy, ayy, always been a trapper
Ayy, ayy, still your favorite rapper
Free 03, free 03, they cap-sayin'
Ayy, ayy, bitch, I'm gang-bangin'
Ooh, ooh, yeah, I'm still Grapin'
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me
Just for every fuckboy that thought that he was shinin' on me
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me
Just for every fuckboy that thought that he was shinin' on me
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me (Ayy, ayy, bitch, bitch, ayy)

[Outro]
Bet I walk into the pen with all this mothafuckin' ice on my wrist, you bitch ass nigga
Steady hatin' on me, steady tryna get people to plot against me
You weird ass nigga, look at me now, nigga
Fuck is you niggas talkin' 'bout? Yeah, I wish I could bring my blower, nigga
But I'ma still have to poke a nigga or somethin'
That's my burner for these five years, 20 years, whatever the fuck they talkin' 'bout, nigga
Do that shit on my mothafuckin' head, nigga, I got bread
Niggas steady hatin' on the king of the mothafuckin' west coast
Nigga, I'm more than that
Nigga, I'm the king of this fuckin' rap game, you weird ass bitch
30 albums, nigga, who did it, nigga?
Biggest deal in the mothafuckin' city, niggas steady sayin' this and that, nigga, it's a whole choppa on me
Shut your weird ass up, nigga
Drummer gang or don't bang, nigga
You know what the fuck goin' on
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Bet I walk into the pen with all these diamonds me
Bitch, ayy, ayy, ayy
For every fuckboy that thought that he was shinin' on me
Bitch, I used to be homeless
Stupid ass nigga
Give a fuck what you sayin' about a nigga, I used to be homeless, you weird ass nigga
Bitch
