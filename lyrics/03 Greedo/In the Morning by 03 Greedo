[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
Roll my weed and suck me in the morning
Rolled over and fuck me when I'm horny
Roll my weed and suck me in the morning
Rolled over and fuck me when I'm horny
Wake me up to it
Need me a bitch who gon' wake me up to it
First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning

[Verse 1]
Look here, bitch
I'm in the Valley gettin' head from a good hair bitch
We gettin' money, only thing that we do here, bitch
And I don't need to know where, bitch
You better hustle right here, better do hair, bitch
Take a class, do eyelash shit, ooh
It don't work, I'ma send that bitch
You gotta get that rich, I need money 'round me
A lot of money 'round me
Countin' all the blue hundreds 'round me
Got lil' mama countin' blue hundreds 'round me
I let her count it, not spent it
I let her count it, not spent it
Fuck her good all night to the morning
Thought the time was splendid

[Chorus]
Roll my weed and suck me in the morning
Rolled over and fuck me when I'm horny
Roll my weed and suck me in the morning
Rolled over and fuck me when I'm horny
Wake me up to it
Need me a bitch who gon' wake me up to it
First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning

[Verse 2]
First she suck the dick
Then she fuck the dick
Then I sent her to the kitchen
Make bacon with the grits
She scrambled all the eggs
I'm mad when I ain't paid
So I hopped out the house and I went to get money
Jumped off the porch with a chopper with hundreds
Ain't talkin' money, talkin' 'bout bullets, I got that hammer
I got that chopper, stick is so long it look like a handle
I got it lit like a candle, we doin' numbers like gameshows
I'm on her head like a Kangol, it just ain't nowhere I can't go

[Chorus]
Roll my weed and suck me in the morning
Rolled over and fuck me when I'm horny
Roll my weed and suck me in the morning
Rolled over and fuck me when I'm horny
Wake me up to it
Need me a bitch who gon' wake me up to it
First thing in the morning
First thing in the morning

[Outro]
First thing, first thing, first thing, first thing
First thing, first thing, first thing, first thing
First thing, first thing, first thing, first thing
First thing, first thing, first thing in the morning
Let me come out real quick
