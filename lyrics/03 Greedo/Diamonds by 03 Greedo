[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
03
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ooh
Ooh
(Beat Boy taught me)

[Chorus]
I can't wait to put them diamonds on my fist
I can't wait to hit the islands with my bitch
I can't wait to get designer on my kicks
I been shining, now she grinding on my dick
All these top notch hoes need project dick
Project dick keep them hoes sick
Her neck, her back, my neck, my wrist
No more Nike on my kicks, might check my bitch

[Verse 1]
White girl from the 'migos that know Katy Perry
Kicked your bitch, kidnap in traffic, no, no Halle Berry
All this dribble got me crossin' over, never carry
Travel with no luggage, when you got a bag, you hurry
Gettin' dressed inside the mall, came in shorts and all
I feel like I'm Lil Flip, this is the way we ball
Gettin' high in high-end, knock out like I'm Tyson
Concrete jungle, wild thoughts, we Rihanna, Bryson
Street nigga with a license, keep it legal when I'm drivin'
Too illegal when inside it, baby, it's a gangster party
Pussy niggas not invited, you ain't never catch a body
Homie ain't about a homi', he still livin' off his mommy
Real nigga, baby, I'm a real nigga
You should fuck a nigga who been workin' on a mil' ticket
I remember meal missing, now I'm on a bill mission
Natural ass like kill semi, baby, you should deal with me

[Chorus]
I can't wait to put them diamonds on my fist
I can't wait to hit the islands with my bitch
I can't wait to get designer on my kicks
I been shining, now she grinding on my dick
All these top notch hoes need project dick
Project dick keep them hoes sick
Her neck, her back, my neck, my wrist
No more Nike on my kicks, might check my bitch

[Verse 2]
I can't wait to stand on niggas who ain't fuck with niggas
I can't wait to fuck these bitches who ain't fuck with niggas
I can't wait to get that Wraith, Audi R8
Only Bimmer I would skate is that i8
Bentley truck, Masi' truck, floatin' in a Tesla
Better have a bank just to get to know me better
Balenciaga bunions, bitch, I'm in a Kenzo sweater
I put Gucci on my glasses, now I'm lookin' better
Ho, touch your tiptoe, insert your info
Might beat it up to the same instrumental
Bitch, what it hit for?
I like them girls with them tattoos and dimples
Not in your face, I'm talkin' 'bout your ass
Blowin' on me like a sax, talkin' all that jazz
Gotta be an SUV if I'ma ride a Jag
Million live, Rodeo Drive, poppin' all the tags

[Chorus]
I can't wait to put them diamonds on my fist
I can't wait to hit the islands with my bitch
I can't wait to get designer on my kicks
I been shining, now she grinding on my dick
All these top notch hoes need project dick
Project dick keep them hoes sick
Her neck, her back, my neck, my wrist
No more Nike on my kicks, might check my bitch
