[Intro]
03
Touchdown in the field, yeah
Touchdown
On my first night out
Touchdown in the field
First night out

[Chorus]
Touchdown, I'm in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
I just was sittin' in the cell
You ain't felt how I feel
You ain't been to no jail
You ain't felt like I feel
Gassed up, just rollin' gas with your head down
Don't get touched by the shell

[Interlude]
Oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Feelin' like my big dawg when he came home
Used to be pissed off 'til I got home
I get right out and go on WorldStar
I hit that pussy like a pornstar
I had to fuck you like I'm fresh out
Every time I go soft, baby, go hard
When you OT, ho, you gon' send me more than postcards
I want to see it, care package
'Fore I receive it, I ain't track it
Well, have you seen it?
I'm askin' around
Oh, it's about to go down
Like I'm back on the run harder
This feel too good for me now

[Chorus]
Touchdown, I'm in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
I just was sittin' in the cell
You ain't felt how I feel
You ain't been to no jail
You ain't felt like I feel
Gassed up, just rollin' gas with your head down
Don't get touched by the shell

[Verse 2]
No, I ain't down to tell
Bitch, I am out on bail
If you can't handle jail
Then don't gangbang or sell
If you win, be prepared
No, don't post it on there
Pin it off Instagram
Pin it on Instagram
Watching out for the feds
Now they know who I am
If I post my location
Then they know where I am
Bitch, I know you looked out for me, feelin'
You just needed some company
Come here, girl, yeah
Bitch, I know you looked out for me, feelin'
But you needed some company
Come here, girl, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Touchdown in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
Field
Touchdown to cause hell
Just was sittin' in the cell
You ain't felt how I feel
You ain't been to no jail
You ain't feel like I feel
Gassed up, just rollin' gas with your head down
By these shells
Yeah
Touchdown, I'm in the field
Hey
No, this ain't the NFL
Touchdown, I'm in the field
Touchdown to cause hell
It's 03, yeah
