Zoomed in and I'm zoning

Bitch, you know I'm Baby Locing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion
Zoomed in and I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused
Bitch, you know I'm Baby Locing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion

[Verse]
Zoomed in and I'm zoning
Tell my nigga pour the potion (Tell my nigga pour the lean)
All my niggas Baby Locing (all my niggas bangin' we)
All my niggas stayin' focused (all my niggas makin' G's), oh
Oh, all my niggas bangin' G's, all my niggas makin' G's

All my bitches gettin' sexy
And my both my boys be pimpin'

Love my hoes way more than jewels
Designer on my fuckin' shoes

Gettin' rich like them fuckin' Jews
If you pussy, I am not amused

[Chorus]
Zoomed in when I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused

Zoomed in and I'm zoning
Bitch, you know I'm staying focused
Bitch, you know I'm Baby Locing
So we gon' keep that shit in motion
