I'm on my way, I'm - on - my - way
I'm on my way, I'm - on - my - way
I'm on my way, I'm - on - my - way
I'm on my way, I'm - on - my - way, I'm

Brill [Verse 1]
I'm on my way, I'mma hit you when I'm closer
I'm on rose, I'm not drunk but ain't sober
She ride like a cheauffer, do everything she's pose to
She likes to blow weed and put ounces in a soda
Fly like a vulture, I like my bitches older
She bump in to me your relationship over
I slide through the joint get it wet like a ocean
She got her legs open she wants me to stroke it
(What!!)
Blowin' out the bag and it's potent
We fuckin' all night long till the early morning
She moanin' and yawnin', I'm gone and I'm back
She saying she want it I'm on it like that
Every night she wants me to slide back
I'll be right back baby when the night back
I need a night cap lemme get the ice pack
Give me one minute don't be mad if I don't type back, I'm

Brill [Verse 2]
I'm on my way, I'mma call you in a minute
Made a stop to get backwoods but all they had were swishers
I'mma bring it when I visit, I'm knowing that she's with it
Had her friend right with her something like an assistant
A vixen, model body looking delicious
I slip this and hit it from the back while I grip hips
I'm off prescriptions, I got persistence
All these suckas hating on me but I'm optimistic
She love young Brill cause I'm not fictitious
She know I keep it real I'm not pretentious
I just beat it up and leave her hot and twitching
Have her ready for another go but I'm off drifting
I got a 4 of syrup but no sprite to mix it
It was a wild night sorry that you missed it
I'mma go and be right back to kick it
But I gotta get right right back to business, I'm
