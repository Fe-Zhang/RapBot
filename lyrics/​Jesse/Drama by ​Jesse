[Intro]
Hey-ahh, hey, hey-ahh, hey

[Chorus]
And you can put me down but you gotta pick me up, mhm
Yeah, and you can poke fun but I might not like it much, no
Pull on my strings, whatever brings you joy, mhm
And we can play around but I'm gonna get serious

[Verse 1]
Sooner or later I'm gonna get anxious again
And I tried to fake it but I'm not the greatest at that, no
I'll get creative and come up with ways to be happy (Smiling)
And you could keep praying but nobody's safe from the end
Not you, not me, not anyone

[Bridge]
Hey! Shoot ya gun at the sun, hit and run now (Right now)
Yeah, you should ruin the fun for everyone, just kill us all now
Hey-ahh, hey, hey-ahh

[Verse 2]
And once in a while you might see me smile and laugh (Ha, ha, ha)
But I'm in denial or probably just high off my ass
I'll get creative and come up with ways to ignore it, mhm
And you could keep praying but nobody's safe from the end

[Outro]
Hey-ahh, hey, hey-ahh
