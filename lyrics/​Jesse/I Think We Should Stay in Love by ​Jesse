[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
The hardest part of makin' love is breakin' up
So if you don't mind, I think we should stay in love
Alright, the hardest part of makin' love, baby, is breakin' up, yeah
So if you don't mind, I think we should stay in love
(Turn me up a little bit, yeah)

[Verse 1]
You don't gotta worry 'bout me
You should be relieved that you ever found me
You know you can say what you need and I'll get it real fast
I'm just tryna save what we have
I get along with your momma, I can hang with your dad
I'm focused on the good, I'm staying 'way from the bad
I'll tell you anything if you ever want to ask
At the end of the day I just pray

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't do this for your advantage
And I don't take what we have for granted, yeah

[Chorus]
The hardest part of makin' love is breakin' up
So if you don't mind, I think we should stay in love, alright
The hardest part of makin' love, baby, is breakin' up, yeah
So if you don't mind, I think we should stay in love

[Bridge]
Dylan Brady
If you stay then we'll all be alright, yeah
Baby, every day is okay with you in my life, yeah
You got some choices waitin' outside, ooo
But they might have to wait 'til the day I die

[Chorus]
The hardest part of makin' love is breakin' up
So if you don't mind, I think we should stay in love, alright
The hardest part of makin' love, baby, is breakin' up, yeah
So if you don't mind, I think we should stay in love

[Outro]
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Don't leave me
