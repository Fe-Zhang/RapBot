[Intro]
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey!)
(Coo-coo)

[Chorus]
Is being sober hopeless?
All I ever think about is smokin'
Now I know why daddy had to keep the bottle open
Uh, I can't blame him, no, I can't blame him
Am I crazy? Seems like everybody is lately (Coo-coo)
Now I understand how mama raised me (I do)
I can't blame her, no, I can't blame her
Not at all (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ask me how I'm doing today
Bet I'll say I'm okay
But I'm rotting away inside (Inside)
Don't worry 'bout it though
Both of us are, you know?
Funny, that's how it goes in life
I'm not tryna be dark
But I just got to the part
Where you stare at the stars
And compare what you are
To everything all around
Wonder what it'd be like
If it all came crashing down

[Pre-Chorus]
You shouldn't talk back to your mother
Or you might get smacked by your mother
Cut a little slack for your father
'Cause he's never comin' back

[Chorus]
Is being sober hopeless?
All I ever think about is smokin' (Yeah)
Now I know why daddy had to keep the bottle open
Uh, I can't blame him, no, I can't blame him
Am I crazy? Seems like everybody is lately (Coo-coo)
Now I understand how mama raised me (I do)
I can't blame her, no, I can't blame her (No, no)

[Verse 2]
I try to say I'm not addicted but
I keep thinking 'bout the blunt
Cut it for a week but I don't think I'd last a month
When I was 17 I didn't think about stuff
Then life got tough
It's gettin' harder every single day (True)
The minute that I wake (True)
The one thing that I crave, it's insane
I need it to stay up (Uh)
Love what Mary Jane does in every situation, oh, yeah
You make it feel painless
My doctor says I should use in moderation but
I just roll myself a J and push it all away
To the back side of my brain, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
You shouldn't talk back to your mother
Or you might get smacked by your mother
Cut a little slack for your father
'Cause he's never comin' back

[Chorus]
Is being sober hopeless?
All I ever think about is smokin' (Yeah)
Now I know why daddy had to keep the bottle open
I can't blame him, no, I can't blame him
Am I crazy? Seems like everybody is lately (Coo-coo)
Now I understand how mama raised me (I do)
I can't blame her, no, I can't blame her

[Outro]
I do
I, I said I really do
Yeah, I really do
I, I do!
Coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I can't blame him, no, I can't blame him
