Touch down in London Heathrow
I won't ever be the same
Miss you more than you know
I know, I'm too far away
In this hotel room
I'll break down soon
When there's no one watching
Hear the dial tone
It's like we're alone
And it's all I wanted
I'll change the lines on this map
I'll change the lines, so our places match
In this hotel room
I'll break down soon
When there's no one watching
Hear the dial tone
It's like we're alone
And it's all I wanted
And I can't disguise
The tears in my eyes give me away
So now that it's gone
I thought I could make it but I was wrong
In this hotel room
I'll break down soon
When there's no one watching
Hear the dial tone
It's like we're alone
And it's all I wanted
In this hotel room
I'll break down soon
When there's no one watching
Hear the dial tone
It's like we're alone
You it's all I wanted
You were all I wanted
You were all I wanted
