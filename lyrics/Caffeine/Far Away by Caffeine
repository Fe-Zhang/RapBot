Guess we're back, and this is how we'll start it
Back on track and we will never lose it
We won't wait, this is how it's gonna be

So sit down, you weren't paying attention
Feet on ground, this is our redemption
We won't wait, this is how it's gonna be

And I'm sorry that it's come to this
A weekend lost in promises
Tears clench through a fist again

And now summer seems so far away
If you could make it through the day
We'd stay the same and everyone would change

But I'm waiting, and it's painful
To watch you change from day to day and memories
But I'm waiting and I know you
I know you're right to watch the crime from far away
You're far away

So we're back and this is how we'll start it
Back on track and we don't want to lose it
We won't wait, this is how it's gonna be

Some let go, leave it all behind you
Just let go, wanna help you through everything
That's the way it's gonna be

And I'm sorry that it's come to this
A weekend lost in promises
Tears clench through a fist again

And now summer seems so far away
If you could make it through the day
We'd stay the same and everyone would change

But I'm waiting, and it's painful
To watch you change from day to day and memories
But I'm waiting and I know you
I know you're right to watch the crime from far away
You're far away

The clock is ticking on our lives
Want to make a difference in this life and
Live it right, live it right

Still I'm waiting, and it's painful
To watch you change from day to day and memories
But I'm waiting and I know you
I know you're right to watch the crime from far away
You're far away
You're far away

All these eyes will cry for far away
