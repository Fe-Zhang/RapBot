[Intro]
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl, you pop, girl, I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane, on that fast train
And our last name should be exact same
Girl, I promise this the last claim that I make

[Verse 1]
I been tryna' get it but it's kinda difficult because the attitude you give me is a little typical
Your body language is becoming invisible and my physical is sick of all these pitiful attempts to fit the syllables, shit
The way I get it is irrelevant 'cause it's a definite that either way I'm gonna benefit
'Cause when I'm in my element, I'm never hesitant 'cause I'm a specialist with some evidence that I'm elegant
Niggas always hating, and they ladies want a piece of me
Other niggas love me and tell me they wanna feature me
Three hundred for a thirty-second verse, I do it easily
If you ain't tryna' fuck, go get some money, do not speak to me
'Cause recently, I been on a whole new frequency
And frequently I been doin' a bunch of shit illegally
Like smoking seven doobies and doing it all repeatedly
So baby, if you wanna come along then take a seat with me

[Chorus]
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane, on that fast train
And our last name should be the exact same
Girl, I promise this the last claim that I make
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane, on that fast train
And our last name should be the exact same
Girl, I promise this the last claim that I make

[Verse 2]
Girl, you already know that I been tryna get it
Everybody want it, I'm gon' try and get it
Baby, I don't even love you, tell me why I'm trippin'
I just want you to be the Lois to my Peter Griffin
You wanted to fall in love, I wanted to hit it
But it's a given that I say 'cause we constantly kissin'
But when you laugh it's not the same, I been on a mission
To find somethin' the same to the days we missin'
Shit, when everybody lookin' at you in public
You supposed to be humble and act like its nothin'
Takin' pictures with fans, man, I never had that
Now I'm just that lucky nigga givin' bitches autographs
Now you wanna be friends, fuck all that
'Member when I rang freshman year and you ain't call back
Now you on Snapchat, asking to lick my ballsack
Acting like these young black bastard'll fall for all that
Fuck no, baby I'm just tryna' do it
I ain't talkin' bout the sexual, I'm talkin' 'bout the music
I'ma do it 'til I die, or 'til I'm whippin' in the Buick
I'ma do it for my casas and I'm workin' with the Jewish
Holy fuckin' shit, my life is changing for the better
I'ma rap until I make a billion dollars all together
But for now everybody lookin' at me, I feel the pressure
However, that shit is just another endeavor
In the meantime, all my old relationships is severed
Including that one girl, even though I wanted to get her
Even though I'll never tell her
Even though I never told her that I love her whatsoever
Even though I'm feeling better
Stop getting high, now I'm focused with no distractions
Now I'm making music, trying to make transactions
Focus on my expansion, so I can get a mansion, but old girl will always be my main attraction

[Chorus]
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane, on that fast train
And our last name should be exact same
Girl, I promise this the last claim that I make
Help me minimize my pride
The way you talk, the way you look
The way you walk, you got me shook
Girl you pop, girl I'm hooked
But you livin' life in that fast lane, on that fast train
And our last name should be exact same
Girl, I promise this the last claim that I make

[Outro]
Girl, I promise this the last claim that I make
Last claim that I make
