Verse 1 *(Maxminelli)*

I'm still a hustla
An we know this
Then you need to quote this on the front page
True that
Never two
On paper view
Wit the blunt blazed
Last time you heard us rhyme
We came out tacklin po-po's
Now we surely stackin chips
But we ain't packagin no doe
See the ho-bos an fiends
They can't get down wit the team
Oh yeah we bout cream
But the colors, mostly green
So brace yourself
I'm a take yo wealth
An leave you traumatized
Bonified hustla
From out the backwoods of the country side

Verse 2 *(J-Von)*

So southside hustlaz throw yo hands in the air
Eastside, westside, northside dont care
Over there, over here
(what?)
Same thing everywhere you go
It's real
Once they waited fo the
Bustaz that hear me know we
Even them guns
An they ready to throw it
I hope I see a nice night for bein this ghetto poet
Ya know it
So it's like me
I'm a play the game rough
An like to tear sumpthin up
Sick shit nigga what?!

Chorus *(J-Von)*

Man fuck y'all niggas
Man fuck y'all bitches
We got the money an switches
But ya can't get wit us
Cuz we the Sickess

Man fuck y'all niggas
Man fuck y'all bitches
Always runnin to get us
But ya can't get wit us
Cuz we the Sickess

Verse 3 *(C-Loc)*

Nigga I can say
Fuck 'em
Cuz they bustaz
Causin ruckus
Cuz they know they can't touch us
Got 'em hollerin "How ya do that there!"
When I bust 'em, can't trust 'em
Struggle fuck that
Hustle, slang crack
The rhyme saw
Niggas bust an get back
I bust back
No hidin, duckin hataz
Hollerin "Fuck 'em niggas"
Ain't nuttin
Now he rich an think a nigga can't touch him
So now they bustin
An me an my cuz OG
An now these fools know they know me
Last time I spanked that ass they called the police
Ya gotta
Know when to hold on, (say what?)
Know when to fold on, (uh-huh)
You better walk away, (boo-yow!)
Before I make ya run
Son
It's unheard
The way we went from slangin birds
An droppin bodies on the curb
To sellin words
Platinum
That's how it happened
It's wicked when I kick it
Wicked
If it ain't broke don't fix it
Clown
Cuz we the Sickess MUTHA FUCKA!

Chorus

Verse 4 *(Young Bleed)*

Watch me spit the Sickess
Shit
You ever heard
An make a million niggas witness
This
Fresh off the curb
Hollerin at ya in ya ears like this
Fuck what ya heard
Face to face wit confrontation my niggas
Ballz an my word
Now if ya ready let me know this real
I'm hoppin out the vehil
Caddy fools bustin ta kill
Some is steady buggin fo nuthin
Lovin my life, keepin my head tight
Bailin the corner on two wheels
Mashin through red lights

Verse 5 *(C-Loc)*

Where yo hood at, (what?)
Throw it up
The club
Yeah we tore it up
Soon as this clown get to buckin
We gonna rush him
Must stop playin wit me
If ya in wit me
You'd a known
I get spaced out
They mace the place out
Then I'm gone
In the Expo
Til the next show
You never know
What we got in stoe
Til the cap
Hit the doe
Hollerin if ya got the paper straight then the show must go on
But when niggas get to breakin shit
It's time to go home
(Ya heard me?)

Chorus
