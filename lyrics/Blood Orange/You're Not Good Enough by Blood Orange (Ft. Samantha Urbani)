[Verse 1]
Deep in the play
I see you as you are lookin' over
Friends in my way
You never could've been a good lover

[Verse 2]
Watch what you say
Could never mean a word and still hurt you
Look the other way
Just tell me that I'm wrong
So wrong

[Chorus]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

[Verse 2]
Forty-nine days
Surely I should be feelin' whole lot better
Ways and ways
You keep on comin' back
I keep lettin' you in

[Chorus]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

[Instrumental]

[Breakdown]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

[Chorus]
I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough
