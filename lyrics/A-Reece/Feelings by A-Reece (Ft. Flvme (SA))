[Intro: A-Reece]
Just make sure you call me back
...
Yeah

[Hook: A-Reece]
Rather catch the flu not feelings
You keep texting me the whole time now
Wish I never showed you where I live
You keep telling me you outside now (yeah)
You know that I tell it how it is
You should stop behaving like a kid
Shoulda known, Shoulda known, Shoulda known
Knew then when you would'nt keep
To your end of the deal

Just make sure you call me back

[Verse 1: Flame]
Rather catch the flu not feelings
But it's crazy how you always on my mind now
I've been tryna call you for a minute
Girl pick up the phone don't waste no time now
Ay
Baby won't you stop with the trippin
Baby won't you stop with the trippin
I swear to God I fucken hate her right now
Yeah
Baby won't you stop with the trippin
Baby won't you stop with the trippin
I just want to see you fucken naked right now

[Verse 2: A-Reece]
Know you like me and I see it on your face
Always say you don't know what to say
Know you got a man I'm in his way
I don't think I wanna take his place
Girl you just got played like NBA
See you got the beauty not the brains
You don't want this shit to go this way
Better get your shit together right now
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I light up the gas forgetting the past
My plans to get all the cash up
You not allowed inside the Hotel
If you ask too many questions
If you ain't down you can leave
Girl you know talking is cheap
Squad goals over yall hoes
Nothing can come in between
All eyes on the kid
No lie he the shit
If I ride then my bro's ride
It's no love in the city
Different shows, Videos
Different bitches and I'd problably let
Them hit it but I'd rather catch the flu not feelings
...
Rather catch the flu not feelings

Just make sure you call me back
