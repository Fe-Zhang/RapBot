I been rapping since, Macy's was Lazarus
My soul dates back to when the savior raised Lazarus/
Now they praise him in the Vatican
But these apes is adamant with a .38 to your abdomen/
I got dogs like a boxer or a pit bull
Better watch it cause that roctwilder will get you/
You the throw in the towel in like a boxer when it sit stool
Carama move the crowd like a mobster when he spit tools/
It's hard to ball when taxes lock you in a fiscal
I can see all I reflect the my optics out my window/
I was in my moms car when that cop cocked his pistol
And said get out the car, in KY that's the type of stuff the pigs do/
Now we riding in porsches from horses and carriages
We were poor but Samaritan, and our resources were paralyse/
We need the Lord in your marriages
But when the GOP says we must Restore America/
What does that mean go back to the shores of Maryland?
Which means we gotta restore the sources of our heritage/
I use to snore off the Clariton, in college lot classes
I took pro black courses so of course this is the narrative/
I take racist to the morgue with the scary men
The .44 airing men I'm a lord to the Aryans/
Poet laureate write poems that bury men
Make a housewife from a whore, I don't judge I just marry em/
We gotta empower our kids, It's more than just parenting
You had a choice before it's either abort or cesarean/
Now you lost trying to find your star on Maurey
Like Denzel when he found God on Glory/
Man I rep for the queens like Nore
I'm a teacher with verses you can read like stories/
The Lord our God, took through war with just scars
Now you in your foreign car With 36 bars of Glory/
Inspire rhymes to rhyme, don't rhymes then go blog about it
And those that don't blog, picket signs & go march about it/
I don't don't care about your fashion
Fam you just rapping, but where's the passion I can't call it art without/
I thank God for history with Obama
For my seeds now we Martin Luther...
