[Hook]

Devine Carama, the Dalai Lama I am a product, of writing real for the Nightquil I rhyme insomnia/ I write ill, despite chills I rhyme in sonas, like I rhyme in Ghana, Barack Obama of the mic skills/ I set precedence, I'm on the precipice of excellence, I rep Lexington and I'm blessed to be a blessing with/ a renewed effort, this is truth and my confession and we combat the devil with this music with a message...

[Devine Carama Verse 1]

For your spiritual profit put some stock in my next verse, we always had fake MCs but now we got a lot worse/ rich white boys whipping they pops jag and then taking they weekly allowance to go and try to cop work/ So they can live what they hear in rap, but if you don't truly live it where's the fear in that/ you ain't brave, you just a slave to the parts born, in the caves of this art forms, where they say stars born/ while pure MCs struggle to stay relevant, the industry cradle these corny rappers that's embellishing/ amount of weed they smoke, how many queens they poked, rounds squeezed from toast, and counting g's on boats/ it's lame, selling your soul to rap Satan's soundtrack, Then when real beasts come, you run away when that pound clap/ See y'all shackled by the need for pounds and daps, me I ain't about that I got freedom of the soul....

[Devine Carama Verse 2]

Its hard to hear rappers bars about Aston Martin, when Trayvon Martin another young black in a coffin/ or seeing your little brother stuff hash in a cigar but can't cut grass because his asma and he's coughing,/
Or cousins in the ghetto who rather con than work, or homies that rock J's just to see a broad twerk/ but I never could afford those so I rock Converse plus I was busy trying to marry the same place that Nas birth/ not a ho but Queens, with confidence bold, that can compliment the soul of king/ love dominant we solders of a regime, that's the opposite of the populace, we are controlled by are dreams/ I'm the modern day Moses chosen to bring a message, homage paid to those that paid the ultimate debt/ I will honor those by taking this flow from
The precipice, of Lex to the apex where the whole globe can see....

[Devine Carama Verse 3]

I'm a lyrical hybrid John Conner and John Carter, my bars bargain with God to stop war and end the slaughter/ of youth psychologically shackled with a few options, rap bars, sale crack or shoot a ball/ I emerge from all 3 to master one, I unraveled God's gift, to teach with rapid tongue/ and I won't stop going in minds until my soul dies, crush pieces of coal into diamond when my flow rhymes/ I want discuss rap upon Oprah's couch, and spit poems out my mouth even Barack consigns/ our youth hold iron and shoot it like Kobe Bryant, I defuse the violence with music to cue a broken silence/ back in the day we invented cool, nowadays we lose ourselves just to be cool/ knowledge is worth more than a man's weight in gold, I teach my daughters Nefertiti to combat Amber Rose/ cause too many stewards is occupying thrones at a ratio, that's crazy plus babies having they own babies it's crazy yo/ the ills of this world will have my little girl giving dome & fellatio in school like Amber Cole/ In a cesspool of lies, the truth is a blessing, Lessons in disguise in the booths my confession/ He rescue my life as a youth I was protected, by the weapons of Christ, renewed in the New Testament....
