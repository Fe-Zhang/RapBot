Hook
[Devine Carama]
She trying to find her self, and she tired of the games, affected by her mama and grand mama's pain/
A young girl struggling trying to find love, In world full of lies that leads her to lust/ and she's chasing a myth cause she's looking for change, 4 years wasted with nothing to gain/

[Marcus McClinton]
There goes a white girl lost.....

Verse 1
Two parent home, house out in the boondocks, closest she ever came to black folks was watching Boondocks/ privilege white girl third year of college, but she worth a hundred mill she just going for the knowledge/ Her dad was one of the colleges biggest boosters, when the board took a pic it was like a college of Lucifers/ see sometimes rich folks logic be the craziest, both of her parents were introvert closet racist/ pops eluded she better never bring home a black boy unless he was a ball player then they didn't say shhhhh/ then she start dating the starting power forward, her dad got excited and said cool invite him over/ 3 months past the experiment ran its course, she just wanted to see if he was hung like a horse/ Nah, he was more like a pony, and in 12 weeks she ain't even really get to know him/ so they met at the Starbucks so she could let him go, but it was too late her daddy was paying his car note/ and the team was undefeated, and he averaged a triple double, she envisioned a fling and envisioned a couple/ She just wanted to see if the myth was really true, but he was about to get drafted so he was looking for a new wife/ she had everything that the white world bought, but she still walking around campus a white girl lost.....

Verse 2
Pops left the house, so inside she thought he hate her, her moms had black guys in and out the trailer/
She grew up lusting that dark skin with full lips, plus she love lyrics by dark men with full lips/ plus she felt emboldened by black men leaving their homes for blond hair women skin color of cool whip/She loved his whip old school rims tented, hood swag tatted up plus a snap back vintage/ Yeah.. It's like a lion in a cage, she in awe from the outside but would never get in it/ Nah.. unless she could win it, so she always suck him off, spread her legs, & let him in it/ but to brother that's lost winning is sex so why would he commit when he's already winning/ Self respect lost, now she's become a crutch, confused love & lust, wondering what's enough/ But she figured a brother and disrespect is synonymous, plus that's part of the allure that turned her on with/ the excitement of living the fast life, she a white a girl but don't like brothers that act white/ and what intrigues her is really only half right, the other half is race of royalty once prominent/ all she saw was Mandingo and rap lyrics, and all he saw was a whore just like her mama was...
