[Hook: Yo-Yo]
Just cruising, Champ and Yo-Yo is on the stroll
From Uptown ??? down to Manhatten
From Brooklyn to Queens, all the way to Staten Island
Just cruising, Champ and Yo-Yo is on the stroll

[Champ MC]
You better watch your back black
Word up cuz these bitches ain't having it
We see things, we grab it
Then we want it, we bag it
Every morning we bag it
Mister don't sleep to hard or I'll pull your card with the quickness
I got the nine and the tec so mind your business
Cuz you don't want me to get illy once I got the philly and the izm in my system
So be about your way, cuz it only takes one punk to make my day
I'm not champion, there's no time to muthafucking bullshit

[Yo-Yo]
Straight out the hood, from the west to the east to see the C-H-A-M-P MC
Cuz noggas ID trying to beef
I didn't peep, I was asleep when the approached us
Champ had to ride on them niggas like a loc'sta
Raise up out your hooptie mr. groupie, and don't reach by the back
I want your music and your motherfucking twenty sack
Champ go get a rope, we bout to tie these niggas up
Show these lil bustas real niggas don't give a fuck

[Hook: Yo-Yo]
Just cruising, Champ and Yo-Yo is on the stroll
From Uptown ??? down to Manhatten
From Brooklyn to Queens, all the way to Staten Island
Just cruising, Champ and Yo-Yo is on the stroll
From east of the bay to South Central LA
No deez in the spot from Compton to Watts
Just cruising, Champ and Yo-Yo is on the stroll
From LA to Oakland, from DC to Texas
We wreck it, and also not burn it, respect it

[Champ MC]
Little do they know they crew out the window
Ain't no doubt niggas knew what Champ and Yo-Yo was about
Money can't buy me love, I keeps the noochie
So talk to me to death my man, you gets no coochie
Just because you're a pretty boy and dress all dip
Don't mean that I'll be the next female on your tip
Because I work hard to be an independent woman
And I got better things to do in my life isntead of hoeing
On the road, roll up another blunt, get in my ride
Nigga was stuck on the other side
Stop that I'm coming in, jumping to music
Coming in, the party was thumping
Now that's what I call a good time
Seeing old friends and watching the acts on stage kick my favorite rhymes
We had fun representing at the show
Ay Yo-Yo, tell them how the story goes

[Hook]

[Yo-Yo]
Yo-Yo, check the funky lingo
On the scene yo, if the scene go, nigga wanna mingle
They know how to bust it bust it bust it while he stunting
Use the hollow tips and score some points while I'm fucking
I'm the competition, trigger finger itching
Listen listen, caught ya snitching, now you need attention
Couldn't fade me then, couldn't fade me now or never
However clever, fly in any weather, in any season
For any reason, tell them girls why they fiending
Dreaming, scheeming, plotting, planning, theiving
Love the smell of Chronic in the morning
Beats a cup of slinger anyday, take a hit and we fade
Treat a nigga like the way he once treat a hooker
Tap that ass and bust a nut like Superfly Shooker
Hate to disrespect ya, disconnect ya
But hit the road jack, jimmy's limp, take your rubber back
