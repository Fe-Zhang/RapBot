[Intro: Champ MC]
Yo, this go out to all the brothas trying to make a living
And recognize a ??? and take care of his family
While a young girl is tricking around with the next man
Sista you know who you are, you better check yourself and keep it real
Thats my word, sista you better recognize

[Champ MC]
Rompers used to try to kick it but never got no play from me
Cuz I was in it for the money, I remember back in the day
I used to get down the same damn way, dudes have no time to play
For those days is over now
Some sistas in the nineties be treatin their man foul
He would do just about anything for you
While he's working his nine to five, you're running through his whole crew
He used to call you all the time on the rega
He bought you a beeper, and now you got a cellular
But know you don't know how to act
Milking his pockets and hitting off his man Pat
Now Pat considers him and your man is bull
But when he turns his back, you're being rude
Playing with his kids and all of that
Damn man, that's how brothas get sent back
They say it only takes two to tango
A brotha will go as far as his woman takes her

[Hook: Michael Speaks]
He does you better than good ice
The brotha has better heart ???
Check yourself and realize
Before it's too late

[Champ MC]
This situation by a kid named black
Who used to chill on the Isle, sell a vile of crack
True it's wrong, but it's hard to make a living
Trying to make dough just to feed his children
Black had a girl who was growin up in the mix
Like hoeing for fast cars and money, but couldn't quit
Jumping the styles of the rich and famous
But Black couldn't take that his bitch had game
Dropped the kids off while shorty got lost
At the club scene, doin the ???, you know what I mean
Rubbin on her neck, man loose after this
She should be home maintaining with the kids
That's the wrong way to bring up the youth
Spill the guts, but just tell the truth
Black was a brotha who liked to be loyal
The corproal was strong, but the milk was spoiled

[Hook]

[Champ MC]
Sistas, open up your eyes and relate
Brithas feel the pain of the love and the hate
Concentrate and use your brain
You said you changed but still remain the same
You got a good man, you better hold on tight to it
Before your eyes knew it, you cold blew it
Cheating and backstabbing that man
You tried to escape because you couldn't understand
But I'm real, I know the deal, this is how I feel
Broathas that are even locked down in the jail cell
Or even on drugs, living the life of a thug
They all live the same, no sense and all ???
But you can take your time to choose
And if you got a good man, better hold on to him
You're on his nuts and dealin with those herbs
You'll be singin that sad song and kicked to the curb, word

[Hook]
