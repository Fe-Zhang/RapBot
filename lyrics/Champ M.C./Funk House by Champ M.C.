[Intro: Champ M.C. talking faintly]

[Champ M.C.]
Niggas don't know what they getting into
I got tricks up my sleeve for bitch ass niggas like you, fuck it
If you wanna come test me, call the cops to arrest me
I pull the plug on my worst enemy
My lyrics teach you how to leave a scar across your grill
You better chill before you cause me to get real ill
But first let me put an end to this discussion
You get slapped with a two piece, knocked out with a concussion
Fuck it, thats how I live it in the nineties
Speaking real candid or get the ??? out the socket
Don't mistake me for a sucka, a punk
Or a bitch ass nigga like yo momma
Thats how Im feeling what I'm dealing with
I be chillin while ya'll niggas be on that bullshit
How does it feel to ?squat a vein? on the next mans dick
Fuckin and suckin every five dollar trick
You on some bullshit

[Interlude: Champ M.C.]
Mic checka one two and like this and like this ya'll and that ya'll
Mic check one two it's like this ya'll
Ayo Champ, I want you to kick that flava flava shit
Comin at you right now, right now, hit it

[Champ M.C.]
I know I be buggin sometimes but I want some more real shit
Hip to the fullest, niggas wish they could just
Fuck with the bitch that got skills
But still, I kill any nigga if I will
Burn and torture that ass so I can see ya blood boil
Dry your ass up and toil with your brain
I'm insane and I can't maintain the pain
I stick a knife in your kidney
Should I hold in your hands so you know I'm thinkin ??
Fuck it, don't let it get to your head
Any ??? my moms and you all can drop dead
So get all your fuckin blunts
And wish luck on the next motherfuck who who thinks they can test me
My mind is all gone, far away as a ??? sheep
Testin me, lyricaaly, I'm not the one, you must be crazy
Gimme the microphone, I heat it up and then I Swayzie

[Interlude: Champ M.C.]
Yeah, know what I'm sayin, check it, check it out
This goes out either one, know what I'm sayin
The real niggas, the FTBs, the Buddha Bandits
Know what I'm sayin, you know how the fuck we do
Know what I'm sayin, nobody here lacking
Cuz the Champ MC's cold macin
Yo hit me with that ??? burst

[Champ M.C.]
Just watch how I flip it, tight shit, always make a smash hit
Gimme the microphone and I'mma rip it
Take it, I always stay mad dip, heat the mic up real quick
Don't gimme no lip, don't gimme no lip, niggas be poppin mad shit
I heard people say I have a split personality
Who gives a fuck, see in reality, that's me G
Who the hell are you to be minding mine?
I got rhymes and tec nines to show bad rap the real time
So you wanna be a gangsta?
Walk around with a cellu' phone and a big ass saker
You're played, and I know what you all about
Yeah yeah, shout it out
I gets down like a nigga and I'm pretty like a bitch
And if you come up to bat, these rhymes will get pitched

[Outro: Champ M.C.]
Yeah, check it out, check it out
Yo I wanna take this fly shit right here to the ???
Polygram representing like a mothafucka, know what I'm sayin?
I got family up in Sant Nick Projects
And they still know I'm representing in the ??? squad, most definatly
Yo, smooth it out like this, check it out
