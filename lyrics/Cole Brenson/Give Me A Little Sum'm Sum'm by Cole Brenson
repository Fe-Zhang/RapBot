I'm the ace of chase when it comes to the trace
Of that sweet pink hoof, like it right in my face
You know I'm money when it come to the honeys
I get so much chicken that it ain't even funny

Tracking the trim, sacking the quim
I'll tag your girl if you ain't watching her, Jim
If she looks like a sinner, I'll buy the bitch dinner
No later than midnight I'll be pouch deep in her

Give me a little sum'm sum'm
The ladies are satisfied when I hump 'em
They give me what I need and then I dump 'em
Baby, let me have a little sum'm sum'm

The booty can't hide when I'm out in my ride
Any cooz I pick up always lets me inside
Like it tight, that's right, I can go all night
I don't give a fuck if they're stupid or bright

My favorite kind likes it in their behind
It hurts 'em at first, but then they dig it and grind
I start fucking faster, make her call me master
I pry her mouth open and then I blast her

Give me a little sum'm sum'm
The ladies are satisfied when I hump 'em
They give me what I need and then I dump 'em
Baby, let me score a little sum'm sum'm

Cruising the malls, a yearning in my balls
I'm famous for scoring in the bathroom stalls
Whenever I want 'em I always get on 'em
A cold day in hell's when I'll use a condom

I found me a chick who's all over my stick
I pulled her aside and then I nailed that trick
Ten minutes of bliss but now it hurts when I piss
The doctor diagnosed me with syphilis

Caught me a little sum'm sum'm
Pain in my testicles when I bump 'em
I don't look at bitches now 'cause I can't hump 'em
Doctor, please prescribe a little sum'm sum'm
