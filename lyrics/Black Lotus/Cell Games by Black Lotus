[Verse: Phe]
Spent a lifetime running from the panic and stress
I have to confess i faced them cause I ran out of breath
I came in swinging like the mood of a manic  depress
And delivered it to the future like the planet express
A limits a mark you ain't passed yet
And perfections a quality you ain't had yet
Sometimes leaving shows how much greener the grass gets
If you the greatest I put you niggas in past tense
And i Remember when we only had 2 views on youtube
Shadow cat the wall to the fame trying to move through
The powers in my hand tell me who I'm supposed to lose to
The scouter's on my head let you niggas think it's a blue tooth
Over 9000 reasons for you losers to back off
Dumping at you niggas body em with the trash talk
Quiet, reserved rappers think that I act soft
No time to sit on thrones I'm too busy rapping my ass off
You should know the story
On how the lotus awoke to glory
Gets a little boring
But legend states when we’re  recording
Brains get distorted exploding
Leaving ya headphones gory
Proving that we monsters outta dexter's laboratory

[Bridge: Phe]
You should probably stay away from my lane
Can't you see I'm tailor made for this game
You dont want to feel the force of my aim
Can't you see I'm tailor made for this game
Even through the harshest parts of my pain
Can't you see I'm tailor made for this game
Even with these drugs melting my brain
Can't you see I'm tailor made for this game

[Hook: Phe & Dimes]
I can't find a better purpose man
I'm priceless and you worthless damn
At this point i really think I'm Cell I swear to god that I'm perfect fam
They never should of let a nigga get in this bitch
Perfection it don't get better than this


[Verse 2: Dimes]
The peak of your talent ain’t reaching my standards
So competition to us is pointless as leaking Atlantis
They get some momentum and hope they keep the advantage
Then realized the lotuses ain’t a feat they can manage
Vivid pictures in my scriptures masterpieces get planted
Wanna picture of perfection take a peak at my canvas
They say I’m cocky conceited and I’m egos outlandish
Cause I think my self worth is more than leasing the planet
All we want is everything I got team full of bandits
That’ll strip you of your cake and then completely just vanish
We’ll peel off like applying to much heat to a bandage
You heard ate we take cake then we feast in your faminish
Getting paid behind bars like a commissary
Music and money the only time my time is varried
I stop chasing pussy, started chasing the cheese now the pussy chase my around like tom and jerry
These other fools at best just number twos
The top spot on lock like Asuka I’ll never lose
Niggas keep on going broke trying to pay dues
We done made our own lane breaking all the rules

[Bridge 2: Dimes]
When you good at something don’t do it for free guess a nigga know my worth unlike these other dudes been killin mics since my first Lp hitting licks on labels and telling rappers to run the jewels

[Hook: Phe & Dimes]
I can't find a better purpose man
I'm priceless and you worthless damn
At this point i really think I'm Cell I swear to god that I'm perfect fam
They never should of let a nigga get in this bitch
Perfection it don't get better than this

[outro: Dimes & Phe]
Group of outcast with two andres
Sounds as chronic and snoop on dre
Bumps like goodie mobs dungeon days
Throne like hova still runs with ye
Ahh who the fuck is this flawless huh
Who the fuck is this flawless huh
Who the fuck is this flawless huh
Who the fuck is this flawless huh
