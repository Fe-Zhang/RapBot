This song is the truth
This song
This song is the truth

[Verse 1]
I had to lie to you because the truth would cause you so much pain
I had to lie to you and I'm a probably have to do it again
I had to lie to you to make the situation turn out better
I had to lie so me and you could still walk off in the sunset together

[Chorus]
Baby, I had to lie
I had to lie
I had to lie
I had to lie

[Verse 2]
I had to lie to you, nah, I had your best interests in mind
I had to lie to you, no, I was really looking out this time
I had to lie to you because the situation called for that
I had to lie 'cause what I would have lost with the truth I could have never got back

[Chorus]
Without a lie
Girl, I had to lie
I had to lie
I had to lie

In Dallas, Fort Worth, Philly and D.C
Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland
Chicago, Detroit, once in Miami
A couple times in Paris, [?????]

Can't you trust me, girl, a word out my mouth
As far as you can throw me, huh?

[????]

[Verse 3]
I had to lie 'cause you, you would have kept yourself behind locked doors
I had to lie 'cause, yo, you wouldn't have known who to trust any more
I had to lie 'cause what at the time seemed like so much fun
I had to lie 'cause when I saw your face you wouldn't have believed what I'd done

[Chorus]
Girl, I had to lie
I had to lie
I had to lie
(This song is the truth)
I had to lie

I had to lie
I had to lie
I had to lie
I had to lie

I had to lie!
This song is the truth
I had to lie
Ahhhhh
I had to lie
Uh, I'm a have to lie
Had to lie
