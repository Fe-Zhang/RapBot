I'm a grown man
Waiting for this world to
Tap me on my shoulder
Tell me that I'm big
And make me rich

Then I
Laugh at all my friends
Who think I'm what they think
Then collect all the shit
That I've been missing

My talents
My lust and my ambition
Give me your attention
I swear to God
He blessed me with this rhythm

But joy and pain
Those are my symptoms
I can make you give in
Cause my lies feed the meter

Oh, come in here
I got that good scent
Girls, I am your boyfriend
Just LOVING you to death

So, when I call
But you better answer
Cause I mean forever
I know I'm fine
I just act like it don't matter

This is all I can do
