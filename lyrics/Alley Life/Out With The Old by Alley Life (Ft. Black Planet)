[Verse 1]
Out with the old in with the new shit
Mark said keep it clean, do this
Straight from the streets
Run and tell them new kid
B.P. is back with the new shit
Who this press don't be a stupid
Useless why you so damn dufus
A.L.K. still be the truest
If you bad mouth me then you gettin' two hits
One to the eye, shit one to the lip
And all this here comin' straight from the hip
And all I wanna do is just make music and get paid
Like the Slim Shady dude did
For the love of the game I'ma do this
Get rap like sex cause I move it
And I'ma sit around for the revenue split
When the band all together taking better new tricks
Cause I...

[Hook 1]
Being in a band it's hard to survive

The same one's that was screaming more more
The same one's that outside the front door
And the same one's gettin' high up in the front row
Also, shit I like to blow doj
Get drunk, throw up right before shows
Do it in the open or on the low low
I don't give fuck, fuck the po-po
Yeah I'm thug and down to throw blows
Cool with it too, bound to go go
If I can't get one pound of the dough
Blaze and get laid round the whole globe

Meet us in 212 at 2:44
Do whatever in the morning and go go go

[Verse 3]
Hold up, now I know you ain't tryin' to be cute
And not salute a soldier
See I expose you, for the dirty rat you are
Found you ain't hard then your life gets scarred
Turn around and player hate my shit
Private, attention!
Forward march, towards your camp
They'll be coming through the dark
Check my style, watch me now
