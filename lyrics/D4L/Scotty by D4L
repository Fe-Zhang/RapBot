I've gotta see my doctor.. Scotty's calling me.. Scotty baby
I'm in the zone I wanna fly mornin, noon, and night

I'm geeked up [8X]

I'm geeked up and I can't see and all the walls keep lookin at me
I tell myself theres nothin wrong but I can't stop grittin my teeth
I can't sleep I can't eat I just geek I just geek
And I know I can't take one so why not three shake it deep
I can't help the way I feel when I geek I keep it real
In the hood I keep my steel
Try to blow my high you will get killed
Cause it's real bankhead real fabo
Broad daylight, don't keep shit low
Roll my blunt right in front of po po
Fuck them hoes the can blame it on the 'dro

I'm in the zone
I've gotta see my doctor.. Scotty's calling me.. Scotty baby
I'm in the zone I wanna fly mornin, noon, and night

I'm geeked up [8X]

Star Trek Star Trek, Scotty don't wanna give a star back
I'm in the zone and I bought me a star gack
And I'm really geeked up thats a star fact
I'm startin to see space ships on bankhead
I roll with gangsters pill poppers anddank heads
I got partners and words the boom buddy and famous
I got sistas like gas mask chocolate porches they dangerous
I fly like blaze when I'm burning purp
Real body heads we burning hurt
Geek music I'm earning turf
While your footballs soft like nerf

I'm in the zone
I've gotta see my doctor.. Scotty's calling me.. Scotty baby
I'm in the zone I wanna fly mornin, noon, and night

I'm geeked up [8X]
