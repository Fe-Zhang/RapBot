With a nine nine shots to my casket droppin and representin las vegas
Sin city blabin long we drop atomic bombs
And we set it all off with a doom when click is to dumb to get this song
Now that you know this song you know we come to close
Til the ship blow up or we have it sold up watch how the money flows
Dropin them cadys hits hit em up hit em up with a lavish twist
On the day I die with a mic on my hand and a fat ass lip

[Eklypss: Doomsday]
Ahhh gets a evil lestic ment to rush
When I commit a shited sometin bout them blody guts

Intensify my thoughts of homicide can't live this life
Gota stick one in your dick skinin you alive
But ain't no time to find a weakeness in me
Set you on fire murda and don't bring no mercy with me
So you could die and burn up
And me and my alibis gonna watch you die gettin high
Should of told your mamma get your casket ready left to lie

[Chorus]
