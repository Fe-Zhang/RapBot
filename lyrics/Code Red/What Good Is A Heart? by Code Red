I told you how I felt
I told you what it meant
But I still haven't changed your mind
I know that you're afraid
You're frightened of the pain
But you can let down your guard...

Cause when we run, when we hide
We deny what's inside...

What good is a heart if you're not gonna use it
What good is a love if you're too scared to choose it
If you're heart is beating, then it's for a reason, girl
If you're not willing to start, what good is a heart?

Don't make the same mistake that people often make
And miss out on a chance for love
You've got to make your move, you've got to make it soon
Cause you're dying inside...

Yes, I'm a man, but I cry
I have fears, I won't lie...

What good is a heart if you're not gonna use it
What good is a love if you're too scared to choose it
If you're heart is beating, then it's for a reason, girl
If you're not even willing to start, what good is a heart?

Come on, babe, you know it, girl
Anyone who looks can see that I'm right
There's a chance here, we could take it
Or regret it for the rest of our lives...

What good is a heart if you're not gonna use it
What good is a love if you're too scared to choose it
If you're heart is beating, then it's for a reason, girl
If you're not even willing to start, what good is a heart?
