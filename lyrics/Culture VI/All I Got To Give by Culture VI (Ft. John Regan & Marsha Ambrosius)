[Verse 1: John Regan]

I've been judged all my life
Criticized about decisions I made
Working non-stop with limited breaks
Giving six-figure efforts, earning minimum wage
I can't sleep - for every blink, there's a cent to be made
I won't rest to until the day of my death
The day they lay me in a grave
And I can say that I gave it my best
Nothing less or I made a mistake
I was lying when I said I was ready to be taken away
Not until the clouds are gone, long away from grey
Knowing it won't rain where my babies stay
Sunshine over my wife, watering my seeds
To raise the plants I laid to make a legacy
I won't stop until my organs give up, my heart gives out
My throat gets cut, whatever deaths got to pitch out
I'm gonna take it to the full count
The last eight ball at the pool house
And even the corner pocket to point out

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]

Sometimes it’s gonna be hard
But we can make it better
Sometimes it don’t work
So we gotta be stronger
You know that I can feel your pain
I know sometimes it's gonna rain
In this life we live
I'll give you all I got to give

[Verse 2: John Regan]

Now I know I'm not the only guy dealing with stress
But why do I gotta be the one that's so familiar with death?
It's like, I know I ain't dreaming, but I can't believe it
Either the grim reaper's here or the banshees' screaming
Here to take a star from my movie off of my set
And I'm the film director screaming with the bullhorn, vexed
And I ain't suicidal, but I'm taking that step to say:
"If you come around again, you're making me next"
My grandpop passed '02 without a clue or a sign at all
My family foundation started to fall
And it was hard losing my grams
She nurtured all the roots of this man
You understand, she was the glue to the fam
It crushed my heart in the hospital seeing her cry
Holding my hand telling me that she was scared to die
I couldn't take it at the wake the straight face she had gave me the shivers
It made me wanna crawl in that coffin with her

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]

Sometimes it’s gonna be hard
But we can make it better
Sometimes it don’t work
So we gotta be stronger
You know that I can feel your pain
I know sometimes it's gonna rain
In this life we live
I'll give you all I got to give

All I got to give
Is my heart and my love
No I can't give up
On all of the things that I fear
Still I miss you so
I wish that you were here

[Verse 3: John Regan]

I had a dream to paint the world that I seen
Then, I seen the world I dreamt
I gave it all I got to give
But I still gotta give more
My little girl's about the only thing I live for
Life ain't a destination - it's a journey
So how I made it here to where I am now concerns me
I don't care where I go
I just care how I get there
And watch the world spin while I sit there

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]

Sometimes it’s gonna be hard
But we can make it better
Sometimes it don’t work
So we gotta be stronger
You know that I can feel your pain
I know sometimes it's gonna rain
In this life we live
I'll give you all I got to give
