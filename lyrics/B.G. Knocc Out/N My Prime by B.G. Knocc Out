[Intro]
Yo E, it's Knocc Out homie
Damn, I ain't seen you like this one, nigga
Fuck, damn man, shit
I just want you to let y- *flatline sound*
Oh fuck, E! E! Man what the fuck
Ey nurse! Nurse! Oh shit! Oh shit!
Motherfucking nigga, man (shit)
I just want you to let you know homie I love you, man
Will carry your legacy nigga, I'ma keep you alive
No matter what! I got you! I got you homie
It's all Compton, I got you

[Verse 1]
I was in the studio with E the day his lungs collapsed
9 days later he died, I said I'm done with rap
Back in the hood, banging with my gungster clap
Moving work, doing dirt and having fun with that
Till they put me on the charge and now I'm facing the (j)ail
County jail main line, now I'm pacing a sale
Going back and forth to court till I got convicted
Ten years with 85 mins man this shit is ridiculous
Corking his main line, I'm thinking it's game time
Got school real quick so I think with the same mind
The gang violence and riots have got me fed up
But through it all stand tall so I walk with my head up
Thinking back when I was whiling putting hammers to jaws
Now I'm in the prison mosque, I'm handling law
Doesn't matter where y'all, the highest pop rapper rock star
Keep God first cause only he is Akbar

[Chorus]
Who can make the hoes go crazy at a show? (ME)
Who was never ever scared to beef with the Row? (ME)
Who was still in school but traveling getting dough? (ME)
Barely in my prime and y'all saying I'm OG? (Hell nah)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life), I'm a BG (for life)

[Verse 2]
When my big homie went out, he didn't deserve it
Tryna say he died of AIDS but Easy was cold murdered
I filtered all the bullshit with my third iris
Full blown AIDS but Tomica ain't got the virus (hmm?)
On his deathbed a lawyer was hired
A few days prior Jerry Heller was fired
See I'm guided by God, you can't suck at me
Can't put it altogether but I smell a bunch of fuckery
No ones in immortal 'cause we all got a day
And if there is a price then we all gotta pay
It's funny when you think, I think y'all got a way
I just pray you go to hell and that's all I gotta say
I'm from the same city from the same pedigree
Never will his name die I'ma carry his legacy
The very reason while I'm stomping on the track
And the very first to do it, he put Compton on the map (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Who can make the hoes go crazy at a show? (ME)
Who was never ever scared to beef with the Row? (ME)
Who was still in school but traveling getting dough? (ME)
Barely in my prime and y'all saying I'm OG? (Hell nah)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life), I'm a BG (for life)

[Verse 3]
I love city bread, original west side
I am the Compton, with big ears to Bed-Stuy
A place would sock a, motherfuckers end up dead why?
'Cause they want beef so we be letting that lead fly
Even with all the corruption and daily casualties
You gotta admit it my city's got personality
Philly had Doc J, we got Doc Dre
If you still ain't convinced check Tayshaun Prince
Alma said it's whiley, a Brandon Jennings
Like Venus and Serena came from humble beginnings
Not to mention all the spitters with these daily mics
Tiny Lister and Anderson, Leslie Sykes
Mayor Omare looking duggie with his suit on
Stafon Johnson on the court getting his swoop on
Try to do good even though we do wrong
Rappers claiming they hood, who you think put you on?

[Chorus]
Who can make the hoes go crazy at a show? (ME)
Who was never ever scared to beef with the Row? (ME)
Who was still in school but traveling getting dough? (ME)
Barely in my prime and y'all saying I'm OG? (Hell nah)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life) Ol' BG (for life)
I'm a BG (for life), I'm a BG (for life)
