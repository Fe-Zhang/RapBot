[Intro: N'fa]
Karma
What goes around comes around right? (Right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They're gonna slap you back (Yeah)
Sometimes it hurts and that's
Bad karma, watch out for it

[Chorus: N'fa]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

[Verse 1: N'fa]
These fat raps think they fit like they the Iron Man
I got the iron tongue and the iron hand, I'll make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet to switch the picture
If ya look in the mirror, you're bound to get a reflection
Like with every action, there is a reaction
With your dodgy actions, you're causing negative drama
And if you know God's law, you best watch for karma
Now I'mma bomb ya, running your traps like tacks
You think you're floating on the cream, you and your rat pack
Well I'm take that, thought back, now let's dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and you's a matador, I'm seeing red, you outta sorts
I'm a target like darts boards, you floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first
While you're shaking, I cut off like umbilicals at birth

[Chorus: N'fa]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

[Verse 2: N'fa]
I look around the city and it's all such a pity
Everybody trying to be pretty, don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block, nobody's playing hopscotch
They're to busy on the internet surfing that rock
Just converse kind of rude, like
"So what you trying to prove, mate?"
I say, "Nothing, I'm just tryna build the feeling, not live like you"
I got plans to take this city up to Senate
As life's one big race and I want all entries to win it
If you're not with it like quitters, then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
You're a disgrace with a sire, you need to recon through your fire
And look higher, higher! (Look around)
I got sounds that help you get down, so you can get up
And avoid them stinking rats that get me fed up
Yeah, they make me wanna throw up, they gotta grow up
Or they'll be feeling abandoned while I'll be sailing like Noah

[Chorus: N'fa]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay

[Interlude: N'fa]
Melbourne, Sydney, to Brisbane, and Darwin
To Perth, Adelaide, Tassie
And all across the O-Z-Z-I-E

[Verse 3: N'fa]
Picture I'm the boulder, it's time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
Had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall, so
I got the key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And I unlock the door, I bring new love to my people
Unlike these fickle fanatics that wanna cause death
Cut hopes late, praying we fall to hell's depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
As what goes up comes down, nevertheless
We stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
Boomerang effect as we all face our karma

[Chorus: N'fa]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives?
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove?
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed?
Well, I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to God that'll I'll be okay-ay-ay
