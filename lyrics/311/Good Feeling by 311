[Intro]
Look up
Look up

[Verse 1]
It's time to surrender, I'm tryin' to remember
'Cause it's been forever since we felt good
And now it's a new day, it's gonna go my way
We're free on the freeway, it sure feels good

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna go back to the days of the past
When everything was easy
But I'm holdin' you close and I'm lettin' her go
'Cause, baby, you're the reason

[Chorus]
I got, I got
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin' about you
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
(Look up)

[Verse 2]
And the old me wouldn't believe it
'Cause my messed up head says I blew it
I don't care, 'cause I'm never gon' quit, not today
'Cause I've found the road and I lost it
Seen the edge, I been hangin' off it
Ain't no river too wide to cross it, on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna go back to the days of the past
When everything was easy
But I'm holdin' you close and I'm lettin' her go
'Cause, baby, you're the reason

[Chorus]
I got, I got
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin' about you
You know it's the real thing
Yeah, it's the real thing
I got, I got
I got a good feelin' about you

[Bridge]
Life is all around
Why you lookin' down?
Life is all around
So look up, look up
Look up, look up
Life is all around
Why you lookin' down?
Life is all around
So look up, look up
Look up, look up

[Pre-Chorus]
Every moment with you, you make everything new
You know we got the real thing
'Cause it feels like the future when we get together
I got a good feelin'
'Cause I wanna go back to the days of the past
When everything was easy
But I'm holdin' you close and I'm letting her go
'Cause, baby, you're the reason

[Chorus]
I got, I got
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin' about you
You know it's the real thing
Yeah, it's the real thing
I got, I got
I got a good feelin' about you
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin'
(So look up, look up)
(Look up, look up)
I got a good feelin', got a good feelin'
I got, I got
I got a good feelin'
(So look up, look up)
Look up
