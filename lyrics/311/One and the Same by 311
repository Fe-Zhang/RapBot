Thinking about when I was real young
Feeling like I was the only one
Pouring the bottom, the state of disconnection
Tell me would it be so bad
When you would come along for the ride
No one can stop us from crossing the line

All I can say is what I will do
Get out of the way or we are going to
Burn the whole thing down
It's what we're gonna do now

I'll show you what it's all about

Come to find out we're highly indivisible
Gonna find out we're something like invincible
You're just in the way 'cause someone led you astray
We come from one and the same

Nothing is vacant
The emptiness feels like it could go on
And go on for the distance
And it says of discontent
When your back is up against the world
Full of resistance
Yeah

All I can say is what I will do
Get out of the way or we are going to
Burn the whole thing down
It's what we're gonna do now

Show you what it's all about

Come to find out we're highly indivisible
Gonna find out we're something like invincible
You're just in the way 'cause someone led you astray
We come from one and the same

One and the same is the yin and the yang
Comprising everything
Greater than the sum of the parts
That's why we got this far
Vital to the survival
Of the human race
That's why we're letting them know
Scream in your fucking face

One in the same with a bang
Do or die with your mains
Ain't nothing's changed
Or so strange burning sage in the caves
We never gauge renegades
Whipping up your parade
No matter age or the decade
We're not lost in a purple haze

Come to find out we're highly indivisible
Gonna find out we're something like invincible
You're just in the way 'cause someone led you astray
We come from one and the same
