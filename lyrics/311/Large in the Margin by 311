Large in the margin my drama unfolds behind closed doors
Told on the down low I beleive that I’m sold but really I don’t know
Maybe it’s better but I can’t think so
Maybe it’s better to fight, one never ever knows
Believe the rumors that grow like tumors
It’s more fun than the truth that we know
Trying to hard to reach a higher plain

Will fuck you up when you least expect it
You think you’re moving closer when suddenly you wrecked it
But all the same the pain gains wisdom
As if you ain’t had enough then you’re in some
Prison of your own creation mental dilation
Look at what you’re facing placing blame in every direction
But in the end it’s your own infection

There’s no way to avoid listening
You’ll always end up listening
Here’s hoping the voices aren’t too unkind
Here’s hoping the voices are benign
It’s easier when you hear it
There’s no reason to fear it
It’s you, you

You think they’ll probably find you
Well then, you’re probably right
Cuz they’ll come back to remind you for eternity
Of when you gave up the fight
Somehow they always will find you
The voices in the night, every night
Keep coming back to remind you for eternity
Of when you gave up the fight

There’s no way to avoid listening
You’ll always end up listening
Here’s hoping the voices aren’t too unkind
Here’s hoping the voices are benign
It’s easier when you hear it
There’s no reason to fear it
It’s you, you
