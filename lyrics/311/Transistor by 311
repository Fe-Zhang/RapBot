If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
Then there’s no luck
Then again if you came for drama then I can’t understand
Music critics, music critics
Not afraid of a guy who’ll tell you he’s never been in a mix
Been in a mix, been in a mix
We’re from the grassroots so big up to our friends
Every crew, every clique, and every posse
Big up to all the heads not of hypocrisy

You’re a transistor
Lightning resistor
Conducting to the mother star
That’s what you are

Renegade sound system three eleven
Renegade sound system three eleven
Renegade sound system three eleven
Renegade sound system three eleven, three eleven
Brothers from another planet and here once again
Automatic, automatic
Quantum saints of the universe in a holographic
Cosmic remix, cosmic remix
From the mysterious blue planet we can breathe anywhere
Underwater, out in space, and in L.A
Your polluted air’s no problem for these homeys

You’re a transistor
Lightning resistor
Conducting to the mother star
That’s what you are

You’re a transistor
Lightning resistor
Conducting to the mother star
That’s what you are
