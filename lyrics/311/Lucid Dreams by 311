[Verse 1]
Chasing time, the days go by
I wonder where you went
Losing light to early nights
'Cause summer’s gone again

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're feeling locked up and you wanna get free
Tryin' to live and love your life in positivity
Don’t be afraid when it comes, fear is only skin deep
Just come on, come on, yeah, come on, come on
When they got you on the run, but you wanna get free
'Cause you dwell under the spell of negativity
And when the world is crashing down, crumbling at your feet
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it

[Chorus]
In my head, it's make believe
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Life is not quite the way it seems
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams

[Verse 2]
Switching lanes, it's getting late
The road is closed ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're feeling locked up and you wanna get free
And you dwell under the spell of negativity
And when the world is crashing down, crumbling at your feet
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it

[Chorus]
In my head, it’s make believe
I don’t feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Life is not quite the way it seems
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams

[Bridge]
Sometimes sunshine is made of knives
A broken promise in disguise
The stars have got their fingers crossed
I’m underneath the same old sky

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you're feeling locked up and you wanna get free
'Cause you're always on the hunt, looking for serenity
Some of the times are gonna be rough
But no matter what it brings
Just lean into it, yeah, lean into it

[Chorus]
In my head, it’s make believe
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Life is not quite the way it seems
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh
I don't feel like I did in my lucid dreams
