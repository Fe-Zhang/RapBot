[Verse 1]
Sound boy proceed to blast into the galaxy
Go back rocket man into the sky you’ll see
Hear it all the time, come back rewind
Aliens are waiting up in the sky
Sound boy proceed to blast into the galaxy
Sound boy when you come round, Sound boy won’t you stay
No one gonna harm you, they all want you to play

[Refrain]
I watch the birds of prey that
Hunt the canyon below my house
Looking for a meal like a lizard or a mouse
I wonder if they appreciate the setting like me
To control your own direction choose to be free
And i reserve the right to be as trite as i want
And you can lick but don’t bite I toss you here to Vermont
I kick it lickity split And hand it to the man in the tan van
And as for you and your crew i don’t hate you
Peace is my priority ‘cuz marley said for sure-ity
Just what do you think i’m doin’? I’m not just here for screwin’
Yo and if it’s sore take care of it Perhaps from too much sucking
But anytime your aware of it then keep on fucking

[Chorus]
You know we cool (isn't that random?)
When we come bout people so clear no fear
We're in your ear
You know we will
So get ready
For comes
Picked up so what

(hey isn't that random?)
You know
Sound boy

It's gonna rock you
(hey isn't that random?)
Oh picked clear
So clear
We're in your ear
You know
People rock steady hey (isn't that random?)

[Verse 2]
To be the one who has it all is not that hard
And i’ll be that type of dude in a funky car
I dream of a suit that will fit my rhyme
When i recognize my girl from a former life
I love it when the only sound that i hear
Is your infectious laughter
I will hear you again in 800 years
If i’m still lucky
Go north on outpost then take a left on mullholland
To me that’s where i like it and macapa drive is callin’
I get up to the sun and then i stretch out
It's beginning to look like summer
And i’m down with no doubt. (swing)

[Chorus]
You know we cool (isn't that random?)
When we come bout make it  clear no fear
So dear and we're in your ear
You know people rocksteady

For comes
I Picked up so what

(hey isn't that random?)
You know
Sound boy

It's gonna rock you
(hey isn't that random?)
Oh picked clear
So clear
We're in your ear
You know
People rock steady hey (isn't that random?)

I break a silly peace for offering
Rap weasel then i’m boffering
I’d give you an exclusive on my playlist
The thought and styles i kick are from a random hat pick
That’s why most radio will never play this tell ‘em again
Me a rude boy from omaha nebraska
Sick as a porno flick yet gold as precious laughter
Many don’t agree but we can’t care about that
‘Cuz we’re never gonna wear the old hat, spoken
