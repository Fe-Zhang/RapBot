[Verse 1: SA]
I'll give you shelter, give you bread, make you live again
Sometimes, it’s half a dozen, sometimes half a ten
Oh boy, it's business after dark
I'm a can of Krylon and you’re a wall I mark
But now leave, I got books to read
And ones to write, so stop botherin' me
It's not racist, or places, or caves I fold
It's bars I drop and these bars is gold

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Hexum]
Far as the nearest star
It's still a great distance despite your insistence
That's what I see
Stay up and away, seizing the day
And know that you're doing fine

[Chorus: Nick Hexum & SA]
Always know that you gotta go do
What ya feel, but don't forget, make it real
No doubt, it’s about stayin’ true
(Nothing gonna stop us)
Always know that you gotta grow, so
Honestly, it's best that you know
Who you are as you go rolling through

[Verse 2: Nick Hexum]
Unbelievable stones, inconceivable tones
Take a bite of it and last longer deep in your bones
In your chromosomes faster, beautiful disaster
We can throw a party, get you out of your homes
I step in the realm, taking the helm
Someone to stand up, I know the history
Breaking it down, whatever the fuck we wanna be
The epitome, a philosophy of music exploration
Thank you for trippin’ with me
(Is he crazy?)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Hexum]
Far as the nearest star
It's still a great distance despite your insistence
That's what I see
Stay up and away, seizing the day
And know that you're doing fine

[Chorus: Nick Hexum & SA]
Always know that you gotta go do
What ya feel, but don’t forget, make it real
No doubt, it's about stayin' true
(Nothing gonna stop us)
Always know that you gotta grow, so
Honestly, it's best that you know
Who you are as you go rolling through

[Bridge: Nick Hexum & SA]
Sackin' many elements and makin' a dent
Meanwhile, I'm racking up the eloquence to say what I meant
Because the bigger the bomb, the bigger the blast
The quicker they go past
I cast and summon the power to come in an hour
'Cause I can outlast
Now everybody wantin' somethin'
Everybody wantin' payoffs
Havin' a blast and amassin' all the chaos

[Outro: Nick Hexum]
As far as my eyes can see at sunup
