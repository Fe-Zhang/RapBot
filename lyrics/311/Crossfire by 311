[Verse 1: Nick Hexum]
I know your password
I know the groove you needed me to master
I had to, no one else can do it, no one faster
Expert with the tech, the Hex will tell you what's next
I get in a state of flow, I know I’m on the apex
Take a big leap, no one can compete, high as we wanna be
Fortified in what she set aside for the economy
A bad beat, back on our feet, high as we wanna be
Freak the freckles off your face, changin' your astronomy

[Chorus: Nick Nexum & SA]
(Crossfire)
Caught in the crossfire
So far, we never missed at all
No man is an island
Even though once I thought I could be
In the crossfire
You really gotta keep your head
Or you'll wind up dead
And I’m not ready for that

[Verse 2: SA]
I'm a hieroglyph, writ on a cliff
That's pokin' out the mist
Once you can decipher my science will fix
And if you're stranded, can't stand it, then I'll gift you a ship
To sail you out of these waters and lead you to fish
There's a methane storm on a planet that’s warm
You’ll find broken shards of pottery and alien forms
Plus a riddle that was left from a conscious queen
That's dynamite, blow your mind like a laser, laser, laser beam

[Chorus: Nick Nexum & SA]
Caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
So far, we never missed at all (Never missed at all)
No man is an island (No man)
Even though once I thought I could be
In the crossfire (Crossfire)
You really gotta keep your head (Keep your head, man)
Or you will wind up dead (Wind up dead)
And I’m not ready for that (Not ready)

[Outro: SA]
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Take a look at my sin
Come on, get it now
Hey, hey
Crossfire
