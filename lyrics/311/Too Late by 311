I’ve been spinning in circles
Stuck in the state of contemplate
By the time that you hear this it will be too late

May not do a bit of good
But I cannot stay in a hopeless way
By the time that you hear this it will be too late, too late

Grasping in the darkness
Making it up as I go along
Find what we needed
Right when you read this
It will be too late

Made our way blindly for way too long
Made our way blindly for way too long

It’s human nature’s attraction to danger
You look around but you won’t see the rangers
Just crazy actin' strangers actin' up major, actin' up major

The river cuts it’s way through stone
Not through sheer force but persistence
At the end of the day the relentless always win

If they wanted to stop us
Opportunity passed 'cause they hesitate
By the time that you hear this it will be too late, too late

Grasping in the darkness
Making it up as we go along
Find what we needed
Right when you read this
It will be too late

Made our way blindly for way too long
Made our way blindly for way too long

Only thing to stop us
Or cutting us off of
A road I’ve been told
That ends in a drop off
The universe explodes
New galaxies pop up
New galaxies pop up

Low on gas, going fast, in the passing lane
All the light in the tunnel was an oncoming train
Out of sight, out of mind, and I'm stuck in a bind
That was the end of the line

Lick shot, king of the block
It’s going down another hard knock
That’s all you got
We’ll turn it up in the mix
They'll hear it out in the sticks
Relay the message from the down towns
With loud sounds we expound
It will be too late
