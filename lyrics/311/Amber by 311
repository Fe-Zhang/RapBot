[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
I got to tell you somethin', this phenomenon
I had to put it in a song and it goes like

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Verse 2]
You wanna know what brings me here, oh
You glide through my head, blind to fear
And I know why

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Break]

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Refrain]
You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence
Unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily
Sometimes you've got to fight

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Verse 3]
Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still, it's fine from afar
And you know that

[Outro]
Whoa, brainstorm, take me away from the norm
Whoa, I got to tell you somethin'
