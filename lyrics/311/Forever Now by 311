You gotta step right in the
Smack in the middle of it
Just get a running start
Don't stop before you begin
It tears you right apart
I'll find whatever I find
And see whatever I see
I'll make the rest of my mind

Hey
For an infinite minute
Let's stop the clock and be in it
What takes you out just forget it
Whatever you will allow
For an infinite minute
Let's find a way to begin it
Forever and now

La la la la la la let me go
I don't need to know
Where the slander goes
Na na na na na you're never there
When you're unaware

Everybody everybody gotta go
Everybody that you know-ow-ow-ow-ow
Everybody everybody gotta go
It's time to jump out of the shadow
Come together for the yesterday's already gone
Forever forever now
Everybody everybody gotta go
Forever now

Taking a ride on a cosmic trip
Getting my kicks while I try to pick apocalypse
Find your light shine around the eclipse
It's something I'll never miss

Hey
For an infinite minute
Let's stop the clock and be in it
What takes you out just forget it
Whatever you will allow
For an infinite minute
Let's find a way to begin it
Forever and now

La la la la la la let me go
I don't need to know
Where the slander goes
Na na na na na you're never there
When you're unaware

Everybody everybody gotta go
Everybody that you know
Everybody everybody gotta go
It's time to jump out of the shadow
Come together for the yesterday's already gone
Forever forever now
Everybody everybody gotta go

Someday I know that you and I will
We will all be gone
But the harmony lives on and on
On and on

Everybody everybody gotta go
Everybody that you know
Everybody everybody gotta go
It's time to jump out of the shadow
Come together for the yesterday's already gone
Forever forever now
Everybody everybody gotta go
Forever now
