Out here on the road
Surrounded yet still alone
But I can't complain
3000 miles separates me from my center stone
The only thing that could fill this hole

Lined up my best intentions
I gave it half a chance
Now no one else I mention
Even worth a second glance

Any day now
We'll be way out
In the country
Where we get to be
Who we
Really are being ourselves
I'm counting the days

I like the view out our window
Bucolic and peaceful
Everyday there are mountains
And sometimes the ocean
But I'd give it all up for
The things I truly adore
What I see when I turn and look
Inside our home
Home home ho-ome home home ho-ome
Mmm
Inside our home
Home home ho-ome home home ho-ome
Mmm
Inside our home

And somehow strange as it may
It's harder for the one who stays
But you don't complain
The thoughts and doubts that'll keep you company for days
You rise above and somehow carry the weight

Any day now
I'll be back out
In the county
Where I get to feel
Alone
When it's just us
Being ourselves
I'm counting the days

I like the view out our window
Bucolic and peaceful
Everyday there are mountains
And sometimes the ocean
But I'd give it all up for
The things I truly adore
What I see when I turn and look
Inside our home
Home

It gets rougher than rough
Harder than this I don't know what could be
But you just take it on easily
There's nothing so worth it
Imperfectly perfect

Home home ho-ome home home ho-ome
Mmm
Inside our home
Home home ho-ome home home ho-ome
Mmm
Inside our home
Home home ho-ome home home ho-ome
Mmm
Inside our home
