[Verse 1]
Wrapped my head around somethin' you said I didn’t know
Making my mind, overflow
Somethin' I just can't let go of
Keep thinkin’ about to break through
Got in too deep, fightin' about what to do
Needed a good talking to
Somethin' I just can't let go of
I think it's about to break through
Do-do-do-do-do you still remember
What you tryin' to dismember?
A construct to destruct

[Chorus]
But all I need
Is a little space and time for my mind
Yeah, all I need
Is a little space and time
To get right back to who I came to
Be, be, be, be
I'll be my takin' time
To get right back to who I came to
Be, be, be, be
I just need to get space so I’ll be takin’ my time

[Bridge]
We all need space and time
Come on now, you know what I'm talkin’ about
The less we stress in excess, the best and no need to
Shout when we're fed up or see dead ends
When there's really no reason or no problems
Come on, real talk, and when our eyes lock, it's called vibin’
We got that space and time, baby, you know what I'm describing
There's a space I'm looking for
I grind all the time, 7/24

[Verse 2]
It's up to you, either you will or you won't
I think you're more damned if you don't
I figured that out long ago, truly
But I'm on a one way highway out of town
I gotta get away or I might have a breakdown, so break it down
So long to this kind of worry and the doubt
I roll the window down and give myself a way out, way out

[Chorus]
But all I need
Is a little space and time for my mind
Yeah, all I need
Is a little space and time to get right back to who I came to
Be, be, be, be
I'll be takin' my time to get right back to who I came to
Be, be, be, be
I just need to get space, I'll be takin' my time
