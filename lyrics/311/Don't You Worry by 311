[Chorus]
Don't you worry, I'll cover your tracks
Help you see beyond the black
Don't you worry, I'll cover your tracks
Help you get your sanity back

[Verse]
Don't you worry, I'll figure it out, figure it out
Need to know just what it's about, what it's about
(What it's about)
Don't you worry, I'll pull you through, pull you through
I will find a way to reach you, way to reach you
Everything that has a beginning has an end

[Chorus]
(Help you get your sanity back)
Don't you worry, I'll cover your tracks
Help you see beyond the black
Don't you worry, I'll cover your tracks
Help you get your sanity

[Outro]
Don't you worry, I'll help you see beyond the black
Don't you worry, I'll help you get your sanity
Don't you worry, I'll find a way
Don't you worry, I'll find a way
