[Verse 1] Nick Hexum
Now I know fools get their own when they chit chat
Haven’t heard yet, but you can bet I’m not with that
With that talk, with the digi walk
I struck a bird, you heard, absurd, word to the fact
I’m a cat, nippin’, sippin’ on the flask
Passin’ it, talkin’ shit, but only if you’re an ass
In front of me cuz you could run from me but
In the end, revenge send ends to the defendant
I can’t get caught in the spiral
Cuz every bit of energy, it goes to my survival
Out my way, I’m a flicka flacka blotter
Ya try to find a weakness, but the shit keeps gettin’ harder

[Chorus] Nick Hexum
Fourth of July
With Lucy in sky
I remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
I was nineteen
I’d do anything
Shit like that now scares me, but I’d like to do it again
It was Independence Day
I’ve seen the other side and I say
Oh, I’ve been insane
And I won’t ever be the same

[Verse 2] S.A Martinez
Cuz we flow we must be fly
First to flow, Nick, oh my brother, so wise
And then I rise
Here’s an ill kid pimpin’ cuz he is so slick
Steps from darkness, his body electric
A drone buzzes the air, a cracklin’ tone
Then boomin’ like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Death defyin’ like Evil Knievel
Words that will wobble awkwards and evil
Cuz he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow, how you like me now
I’ve returned the kiss of death, the last Damien
From the abyss, a fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless ways, I’ma do damage
To the wack MCs, I know you can’t stand this
Right about now, get down, I’m the annihilator
Rockin’ with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

[Chorus]
