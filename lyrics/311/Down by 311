[Verse 1: S.A]
Chill
Light on my side as my ego becomes
A funky child with some words on my tongue
Be like intake of breath and my mouth gets loose
So while I scatter my spit, I dream of juice
Have you ever made out in dark hallways?
Displayed a kiss that made the day?
Or, say, play a track from your record collection
It's your mix, congratulations

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

[Verse 2: SA]
I bet you light up when we start the show
Follow me now, very closely 'cause I told you so
You know we glow because we throw sun rays
Now we be freaky and we want to stay (unh)

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now

[Verse 3: SA]
Lighting strikes, yo we be in that violent force of light
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as Dolemite
Because we're dope, kid, change like the chameleon
And the channel, whatever the whack show the "Real World" is on
You know we dazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles
Rattle inside your head, feel redeemed like cola bottles
Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made
Check the technique, 311 in L. A

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now

[Verse 4: Nick Hexum]
Keep my feet on the ground
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound
It comes from the down, and

[Chorus: Nick Hexum]
We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now
