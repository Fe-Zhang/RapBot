Uncalm, uncalm, uncalm

Listen to the drummer just listen to the strings
Listen to the DJ just rappin' and things
Once I get a message from you I get all edgy
My mind's racing but my you know not ready uh

For you, baby all our dreams trickle through
We are back in your teenage bedroom
Salvador Dali honeymoon for you

It’s like you and me on Plymouth Rock
Embarking on a journey that I never thought
Would happen to me so effortlessly
Sparks flying, your laughter is a symphony
Spring, what a little moonlight can do
Soon the summer sun is on you
All the while we don’t hear the news or feel blue

On the scales of desire your absence weighs
More than someone else’s presence
I wanna kiss reason goodbye today
I wanna show its purple essence
On your lips baby it’ll fade away
Return your natural iridescence
On the scales of desire your absence weighs
More than someone else’s presence

You make me feel uncalm and I think I like it
Make me think of a song that I could not write yet
Melodies create themselves I’m just a conduit
You make my heart accelerate and I’m on to it
For you, baby there’s so much that I will do
To be near the sweetness on you
Funny everything seems so new when with you

On the scales of desire your absence weighs
More than someone else’s presence
I wanna kiss reason goodbye today
I wanna show its purple essence
On your lips baby it’ll fade away
Return your natural iridescence
On the scales of desire your absence weighs
More than someone else’s presence
Uncalm, uncalm
