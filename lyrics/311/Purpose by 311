I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I’ll never see you again then again who knows
Make me quiver hands will shiver
Still got all the things that i woulda give her
Yeah, yeah but it’s slow going
Something’s showing yeah, yeah

Love is a stream that will find it’s own course
Making due is a thing a thing i will do no more
Whenever you come back i’ll be waiting
Trifling the slack no head gating
This is all pure fiction you know that’s right
Just pure fiction that’s all right

I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I’ll never see you again then again who knows
Make me quiver hands will shiver
Still got all the things that i woulda give her
But it’s slow going something’s showing
Yeah, yeah
