Start the game, I'm breaking all that came
You know that you have lost at the second you delay
Play the gate, it lies in your biology
Rising up the temperature, useless technology
Park the car and walk under the stars
So goddamn afraid to let down your gua-a-ard
You can see I'm talking bu-bu-but me
That's just what it is like in the wildfire

It's me me me
I am more than what you see
Pouring out my cranium on the m-i-c
I'm gonna come in harder
To the thirsty bringing water
Thought you wanted it to get higher
But you're in the wildfire now

Someone told you that you had no chance
People told us it would never transpire
You could be defeated in advance
Just let them all burn in the wildfire

Let me tell you what you might not know
When the chips are down I mean lower than low
You might think this dude won't show
Cause I done robbed Knox and took all the gold
We'll overcome with our squad and we'll get in the mix
And you can pray to your god but your god can't fix
How I look at this world and if I am crying
It's cause I'm at the bigger life and I'm a die laughing
Haha

Whether you think you can
Whether you think you can't
Either way you're right
Tell ya whether you think you can
Whether you think you can't
Brother, you're right on

Someone told you that you had no chance
People told us it would never transpire
You could be defeated in advance
Just let them all burn in the wildfire

Life goes on and on
The decisions so many times they make themselves
And in the aftermath
You cannot take it back
Your point of view is everything
That you're making
Rude awakening
Hate to be the one to tell you so
I thought that you should know
Cause that's what I'm here for
Told you I'd never go

And when the morning comes
You know I'll still be here
One thing you should not fear
Whatever things that come
Through the rain
And the sunshine and the pain
We'll look back and smile
When all is said and been done
When the song is sung
