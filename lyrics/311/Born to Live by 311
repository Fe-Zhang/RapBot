[Verse 1]
Back when I was just a kid
Skin was paper thin
Folded up like origami
Turned the sensitivity in me into an army
Standing at the castle walls that stood before me
I couldn't climb until I learned to let the people in
Even though it hurt me, lit the fire from within
Made me feel like I can make it through anything
No matter what they bring, tell me that I'll never win

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I need is right in front of me
I wanna bridge the gap and feel the unity
Yeah, everything I need is in the air I breathe
You get back what you give, and I was born to live, born to live

[Chorus]
I know all that you've been through
Feeling like you might not make it alone
'Cause I have walked a mile in your shoes
Yeah, I know all that you
I know all that you've been through

[Verse 2]
I wanna see the empire fall
Before I go, I wanna see justice for 'em all
I wanna see my daughters get married
But I can't if I'm in the cemetery
I can hear it when it calls
The call of the void I'll avoid til the very end
'Til the bad guys lose and the good guys win
'Til the grabbers lose their grip, ripped from under my skin
I'ma take a deep breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I need is right in front of me
I wanna bridge the gap and feel the unity
Yeah, everything I need is in the air I breathe
You get back what you give, and I was born to live, born to live

[Chorus]
I know all that you've been through
Feeling like you might not make it alone
'Cause I have walked a mile in your shoes
Yeah, I know all that you
I know all that you've been through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh
I was born to live, born to live
Oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh
I was born to live, born to live

[Bridge]
When I go to bed at night, I sleep with my demons
Pull the covers tight, the world could be freezing
I try to see the future through my daughter's eyes
Hoping they can see beyond the grey skies

[Chorus]
I know all that you've been through
Feeling like you might not make it alone
'Cause I have walked a mile in your shoes
Yeah, I know all that you
I know all that you've been
I know all that you've been through
Feeling like you might not make it alone
'Cause I have walked a mile in your shoes
Yeah, I know all that you
I know all that you've been through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh
I was born to live, born to live
Oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh, oh we yea oh
I was born to live, born to live
