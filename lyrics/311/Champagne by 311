I will never understand you
When will I stop trying
I mean, 'cause it’s just not how I planned to
Spend my time til’ dying, I mean

Champagne, California on the brain
She’s got an appetite for no refrains
Just verses, she curses as blood vessels burst in defiance
She made an alliance to the dark side of Hollywood
Where everything looks good
So I treat her as any other player would
Lightly, then she wants to fight me
Too bad, that’s just too bad
I can’t be around to pick up your bags and your debts
She wants to love me with threats
Not taking chances, I’m hedging my bets
With other girls, I’m not providing pearls
I’m free, free

I will never understand you
When will I stop trying
I mean, 'cause it’s just not how I planned to
Spend my time til’ dying, I mean

I know loving me isn’t easy
I’m home and next thing I’m leaving
But when I look at you it’s like praying with my eyes
I follow you to sleep so I will find
Your dream place and hey, I’m not an angel
But girl you make me feel like I know one, one

Champagne, California on the brain
She’s got an appetite for no refrains
Just verses, she curses as blood vessels burst in defiance
She made an alliance to the dark side of Hollywood
Where everything looks so good
So I treat her as any other sucker would
Tightly, then she wants to fight me
Too bad, that’s just too bad
I can’t be around to pick up your bags and your debts
She wants to love me with threats
I’m not taking chances, I’m hedging with my bets
With other girls, I’m not providing pearls
I’m free, free

Never understand
