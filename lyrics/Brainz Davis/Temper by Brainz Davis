{*Brainz Davis hyperventilates then yells*}

[Chorus 2X]
When your body's sweatin bullets
Pacin loaded 'nuff to pull it so
You won't hesitate to pull it niggaaaah - I'm TEMPER!
I got you 'roid ragin, out your frame, actin crazy
I done turn your sunny day shady, bustaaaah - I'm TEMPER!

Hey everybody, I'm that feeling in your body
That be getting people all riled up, to kill somebody (TEMPER!)
I'm like an adrenaline rush, I might just make you veins bust!
I hold the record for sendin them niggas off in them handcuffs
I blow your TOP, I make you HOT, I make you uglier to WATCH
Like you some kin to Jekkel Doc, niggaaah! (AHHHHHHH!)
(TEMPER!) I split marriages, break up any friendships
Because of me, I'll bring the innermost relationships
I got you heated, got you ready to brawl!!
Got you bouncin off the walls like you done lost it all!!!
Got you screamin at the top, "I CAIN'T STAND NEAR TO Y'ALL!!"
Now you stuck by yourself wit no family to call! (TEMPER!)
I'll make you remember about some shit back in the past
Now you ridin down the street to go kick somebody's ass!!
I'll make you wake up in the wrong side of the sack
With STRESS splattered on your back
Ready to go and get the Mac and RAT-TAT-TAT! DAMN!!

[Chorus 2X - w/ angry yells in background]

I just, LOVE IT when I be fucking wit Mr. Davis
He a Gemini, that's easy access - man, I'm the greatest!
I ain't Ali, but I sting like a bumble
As long as snakes stay in the grass
I could last, cause his day won't be humble
I made him rumble and tumble, I seen his whole life crumble
Now he's stuck behind BARS, walkin through a dark tunnel
He usually calm and collected, I ain't respected, I got him
I'll make him push you off a building and watch you fall to the bottom!!
He usually calm and collected, I ain't respected, I got him!!
I'LL MAKE HIM PUSH YOU OFF A BUILDING AND WATCH YOU FALL TO THE BOTTOM!!!!! (Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!)
I'll have him locked down in anger management class
Bust some shit back in the past
A hundred and fifty-two written assignments he won't LAST!!
Got a short-wit wit no patience! Pissed off back and forth pacin!
Time to get it together, it'll get better, but his time wastin!!
So when his blood boils, give him fifty feet
Or YOU GON FIND HIS FEET NEEDED, BUMP YO ASS WHEN IT'S HEAT, CHEAA!!!!

[Chorus 4X - w/ angry yells in background]

[Brainz Davis - Outro]
Hahahahaha...We ain't even mad at you
I'm just touchin some real shit that niggas go through
Keep your temper down, peeler..
