If I don't live the struggle, then why do I flow
I'm just another Wigger man, what do I know
If y'all don't wanna hear the way the truth unfolds
Just cover your ears and say na na na na

It's like we sleep safe but we walk with danger
They say in Jamaica, Queens don't talk to strangers
It's like we look for violence in our darkest neighbours
But it's the stillest snakes that'll spit the harshest vapours
It seems it's always random shootings never bout karma
Ain't done shit? You're a target, ask Pantera guitarist
But hold up a second. I remember this concert
Pantera in Verdun when I was just a kid mosher
I remember the lead singer cough up and say
To a bouncer "Hey nigga, get the fuck off the stage"
Sometimes you get murked for the word that you spit
Not saying he deserved it, but we should learn from it
C'mon go further with it. because we're hurting from it
Stop this fucking madness instead of nurturing it
With blacks it's been about sacrifice and cost
But whites seem to think that it's a paradise lost

If I don't live the struggle, then why do I flow
I'm just another Wigger man, what do I know
If y'all don't wanna hear the way the truth unfolds
Just cover your ears and say na na na na

In the 21st Century it's movie trash race hate
What's the difference 'tween White Chicks and black face paint
Birth of a Nation or the death of the dream
It's like Jackie's still trying to earn respect from his team
Affirmative Action or negative stalemate?
Is that a free black man or relative Jailbait
Everybody knows that one discreet bigot
Who says "Listen, I've had coloureds over to eat dinner"
Or that white girl who thinks its trendy to date a brother
Or does it cause she wants to get back at her mother
Or maybe she just dates him cause she knows that he's bigger
But when they break up, the first thing she calls him is
"Hey! They say the n-word why can't we?"  Go figure
Civil rights don't give whites the right to say nigga
"But Anni you just said it", I guess I don't get it
But maybe a word can only harm us if we let it

If I don't live the struggle, then why do I flow
I'm just another Wigger man, what do I know
If y'all don't wanna hear the way the truth unfolds
Just cover your ears and say na na na na

I know these ain't common topics that make up a song
I know a lot of cats will end up taking it wrong
Rodney said to get along, it's taking way too long
Maybe both sides have a pride that's way too strong
Yeah, I'm thieving black music, but I'm giving back to it
I'm facing this shit head on, ain't putting my back to it
If only Kipling had had a chat with Du Bois
Jim Crow might of died sooner, replaced by new law
If Josh Gibson had had the chance to hold the bat
Then they wouldn't keep hating on that black quarterback
If actor Paul Robeson was allowed to prosper
Then Malcolm X would have won Denzel the Oscar
If Ol' Blue Eyes had played the Apollo with John Coltrane
Then in 2004 there would have been no Soul Plane
If Sam Cooke could have rocked the mic with Elvis
Then Dr. King might not have lost his life in Memphis

REPEAT CHORUS
