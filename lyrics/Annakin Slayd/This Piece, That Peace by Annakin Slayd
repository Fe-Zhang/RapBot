Hey you. What's the state of rap at?
I spit about peace and love at the risk of being laughed at
But I clap back like a sound clash applause
Rap rules, no peace Stalwart'll smash laws
Hey you. Looking dull-eyed and raising the flag
You got Freedom but no truth, that's no reason to brag
Hey you. Sitting in that broadcaster's chair
Those truthless eyes, Struggle to look passed your stare
Hey you. Posing with that cocked forty-five
I stunt truth is God with my heart fortified
Hey you. With that Teflon vest
Six shots in the chest and you haven't learned your lesson yet?
Hey you. Saluting with those army fatigues
Lost in the desert, you don't know what all of this means
Speak of war, while I quote Mahatma Gan
And spit hymns of truth until the crack of dawn

[Chorus]
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
With light in mind you'll find truth sometimes
Don't wanna rap about this piece no more
I think I'll talk about that peace some more

Hey you. Strapped with TNT
You're a stalwart entity
This is not the path to paradise
Hey you, on the campaign trail
You don't know what's happening here
Greatness only comes through sacrifice
Hey you. Little ghetto boy
You keep saying you have no choice
But everything has got to get better
Hey you. Glued to TV screen
Your brain is washed but it's not clean
And Mother Earth will die if we let her

An eye for an eye makes the world blind
With truth in mind you'll find light sometimes
Don't wanna rap about this piece no more
Just wanna sing about that peace some more
An eye for an eye makes the world blind
With truth in mind you'll find peace sometimes
Don't wanna rap about this piece no more
Just wanna sing about that peace some more
And sing the hymn of truth
