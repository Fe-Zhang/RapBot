[Hook:]
Montreal stand up, let 'em hear us
It's 25 for 67 now can you feel it
Come on Habs fans stand up all together
Yell MTL for life, les Canadiens forever

[Verse 1: Annakin Slayd]
Annie Slayd's got a change in the rally theme in the same rhyme
Take back the game and cup at the same time
It's like, it's us against the world right now
But were Habs, we never let the torch die down
A unified city has spoken
Cause we don't wanna see another young man broken
This is a movement, And you don't gotta chance to stop it
So I bust m Pacioretty shirt and rock it
If that's a hockey play, then hockey must change
Wanna be proud of our sport, not ashamed
It ain't about attempt, it ain't about blame
Were doin' this for Max, were doin' it for the game
Tryin' to open some eyes
But you can't break the spirit and Canadiens pride
I know one way to keep this feelin' alive
How about 67 for 25...

[Hook:]
Montreal stand up, let em' hear us
It's 25 for 67 now can you feel it
Come on Habs fans stand up all together
Yell MTL for life, les Canadiens forever

[Verse 2: Annakin Slayd]
'Betcha didn't know that blood was thicker than ice
This team is a family, we stand together in a fight
The ones who riot, you know they ain't the real fans
It's the twenty-one thousand in the stands
The ones who give the 10 minute ovations
Can't appreciate it unless you've felt the vibrations
Were the home team you don't wanna be facin'
The one's who've celebrated more than any in the nation
It's easy to hate on the ones who speak up
It's easy to hate the one with all the cups
Boston and Philly love to slander us
But they don't got half as many fans as us
Pickin' on PK, they got a hate on him
Maybe because they know they can't skate with him
T-Dot, it's like they're afraid of him
I wouldn't take the whole team in a trade for him
No more nice guy, Annie Slayd
Best fans in the game, (screw?) what they say
I know one way to keep our spirits high
How about 76 for 25...

[Hook:]
Montreal stand up, let em' hear us
It's 25 for 67 now can you feel it
Come on Habs fans stand up all together
Yell MTL for life, les Canadiens forever
Greatest fans in the world, are you ready
Why not win it all for Max Pacioretty
Come on Habs fans stand up all together
Yell MTL for life, les Canadiens forever

[Outro]
THIS ONE'S FOR THE GREATEST FANS IN HOCKEY
JUST WANTED TO REMIND THE HATERS, '77, '78, '79, '02, '04, '08
THOSE NUMBERS MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU BOSTON?
IT MEANS WE'RE IN YOUR HEAD, AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE, Montreal STAND UP!
Habs for life, MTL forever
Montreal for life, Canadiens forever! (x2)
