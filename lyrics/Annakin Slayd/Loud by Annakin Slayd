Sometimes I press my palm onto my chest to make sure I'm alive
Sometimes I slam on the brakes before I find the drive
Got a soapbox to stand on, a torch to hand on
Flyin' high but we ain't got no runway to land on
I see these cats flossing in their Sean John suits
It's like they don't give a fuck if their mic's on mute
I see the violence, the girls, the diamonds, the pearls
But the only thing forever is the rhyming, these words
Can I make it the game without being greedy
Can I get the love that I want without being needy
In every two second line, I fit fifteen words
That's two hundred forty truths for every sixteen verse
I made a wish to be rich on each Hi Ho
But knowing is half the battle for each GI: JOE
Yo! our parents didn't consider this music
Maybe it's cuz we never figured out how to use it

When I'm out and down
I crank the volume loud
Cuz I've been waiting for so long to sing it out
Lalalalaloud
Lalalalaloud
Lalalalaloud

It's like I'm losing I'm mind, and that ain't good for my sanity
They told me life ain't fair and that ain't good for my vanity
Trying to get to the ends, but I can't find the means
Trying to sew up the world because it's not what it seems
It's just me, Johnny Walker Black and Lamont Dozier
I'm drunk off the music and I don't wanna be sober
I know that Anni's starting to sound like a downer
But every year my birth certificate gets browner
It's harder to give up so I keep going
It's difficult to shut up so I keep flowing
It's impossible to lay down so I keep fighting
Sick of all the barking, so I keep biting
They're trying to close me down, but I won't pack up
I'm like porn site man, I pop back up
It seems like hip hop dies a little each day
Rappers don't have to sing, but I'mma do it anyway

When I'm out and down
I crank the volume loud
Cuz I've been waiting for so long to sing it out
Lalalalaloud
Lalalalaloud
Lalalalaloud

I'm gonna do it now, I'm gonna do it now
Before my time runs out, I've gotta let it out
I've gotta sing it loud

They say to listen to your heart, that's why I speak to the beat
Trying to find my direction like "Never eat Shredded Wheat"
I know it's a material world but I don't like the texture
I guess I could go on and on, but I don't like to lecture
Tell me what's the point when it might go right through ya
So I'mma stop talking shit and let this music do ya
Cause when I think about High School I pop in theWu
When I hear Al green I think of my ex-boo
Can't listen to Kanye without seeing Cancun
When I play that Pac song and think of my Mom too
And Stevie Nicks reminds me of the woman I love
And Stevie Wonder makes me think of heaven above
Listen, this track's sounding like an Oprah show
Anni usually likes to take a less hopeful note
Yeah, I wanna say that hip hop is poised to die
But sometimes I should shut up and just enjoy the ride

When I'm out and down
I put the volume loud
I've been waiting for so long to sing it out
Lalalalaloud
Lalalalaloud
Lalalalaloud

I'm gonna do it now, I'm gonna do it now
Before my time runs out, I've gotta let it out
I've gotta sing it loud
