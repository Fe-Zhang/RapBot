"The roughest, The roughest, roughest (Say What?, Say What?)"

Why can't anyone understand that I'm meticulous
I reek of putrefied flesh
The soul serrated, contaminated with rhymes illaminated
Exhuming each and every last cell from you
Kind of clinical, forensical, with sound under
Clowned dumber niggas then you wack 'em with round numbers
Sound runners when I swarm with spawn to the sound comers
In an embryonic state I race like cess in a crepitating bowel
Caused by stress, makes up a large mess
Of your whole mic, death of your soul's like, foul sense
When spit drips from your oral cavity; I slit wrists
The blood letter with a Beretta, don't give a playfight
Bust this sis rip shits on your grave site
Then I make charred remains of your methylated blastoma
Til the last bone in your coffin was off him
Then I spat on ya, rancid remains lay stinkin'
Even OJ ask "What the F*CK was you thinking?!"

"The roughest, The roughest, roughest (Say What?, Say What?)"

I'm sick, I crash cadavers and suck brains through it
Cerebellums kaleidoscopic; my melon retains fluid
Divine intervention between your liver and spleen
Seems erratic, static, having mattered to splattered
Slightly burned dermis, then dusk gets faded, decorated
My desecrated cauldron where I slew men
All in fallin', like blazing glass that shatter in
The megaloblastic anemia, your blood scatters
And run for cover, from the organism X
Born to kick in necks, to spawn the written texts
Spit'll trickles and oxidates to levels of blaspheme
And devils, I was last seen with shovels taking
Kidneys; collapsing jaundice, who spit? Suck it
Irrigating, invading; I'm shoving mics up your tuchus
All types of shit gets stripped from your hollow husk
I swallow dust and moisten your corpse with aloe musk
Plus trespassers get bust by just'
The cuts releases diseases, Jesus must have rushed on us
Crusts of pus drips on the blade then I lick it
Hold your sack and split it from you queue biters to ditches, damn

"The roughest, The roughest, roughest (Say What?, Say What?)"
