[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
I need my shit man, what the fuck, yo
Any mescaline tab can go for a buck
What you mean?
Don't try that shit
Fuck it, I see a metal rocks
I keep a 2 checks, X-X-X-X
Walking around with a demo raw
Takin' a cheesecakes I filled with Tylenol
Down on graham hand man damn first street
Tell 'em the drugs, the copy take with sure beat
Goin' to Cali, time to shoot it up
You can't find a vein?
My pants leg, pull it up
Down I go, low bro, Kool Keith and Don
Funky junkies in the studio
Searching for Green Tom
Searching for green, stop
Have you seen Maggie?
The latest news...
(Eyyy you heard Carlos died?)
Yeah!
Fuck, he's stealing our stuff
The kid out the block
Bobbito shit is rough
I got my VHS (what the Sony sell)
Raps in packs for fuckin' double L
Uptown, downtown, my TV, my radio
Gimme my shit 'cause I'm in stereo

[Verse 2: Godfather Don]
Hit me up today, I'll pay you tomorrow Annie
I'll sell my granny, I'll eat the fanny for a grammie
I make them panties wet, wake up
I sticky government, ex-excedrin
Heroin shooting, mescaline dabs on the
Tip of my tongue and I flip and I flung
I'm killing my lungs with some mama histamines and Mr. Clean
[?], eucalyptus, big risk
Let me clear out my nose so I can sniff this...
*sniffing*
Shit!
My head's feelin'- my head's feelin' light, uh...
I melt the mic-uh!
I smoke the mic-uh!
I'm yellin' to right, they pushin' bitches checkin'
For a way [?] beat my dick hard
From the windowpane I'm seeing colors
Purple rain, purple rain
The stain on my brain spear
Candles lit the flame
Now I'm on some red [?] shit
Esoterical, neo-spiritual
Dirty whores, I'm hitting honies
Your money is staring through cracks in the pavement
I see Madsol, Bobbito told me don't do it but I'm an asshole
Dab of mesc, lasted, now I'm blasted
I'm dope nigga
I smoke opponents like plastic
So don't step to me bro
Unless you got a needle
I'm not funky [?]
