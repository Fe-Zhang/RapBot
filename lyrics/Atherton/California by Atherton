Hello hello hello
I'm glad I've found you
Been away a long long time
The sun will rise
And the sun will set tomorrow
And it's been rough on this old heart

You are, you are the only reason I have found
Come down, come down, come get me off the ground
I waited for you yesterday
To come on back and say you'll always stay

Come back home to California
Find a better way to make it through today
Come back home to California
The lights they shine so bright
They shine for you tonight
So come on baby
Come home to California

We can drive the coast of San Fransisco
Head on down to Hollywood
Hurry please
Summer's almost over
You know I'm fading and I wish you would

You are, you are the only reason I have found
Come down, come down, come get me off the ground
I waited for you yesterday
To come on back and say you'll always stay

Come on home to California
Find a better way to make it through today
Come back home to California
The lights they shine so bright
They shine for you tonight
So come on baby
Come home to California

Come home to California
California
California
California
California
California
California
