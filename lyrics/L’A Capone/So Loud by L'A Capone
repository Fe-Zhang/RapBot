[Intro]
Yeah
Richy Moe
So loud, yeah, so loud
Swagg B
So loud, loud

[Chorus]
Pull up on a bitch so loud
And the watch on my wrist bling-blow
Good dope in the Swish so loud
Ben Frank roll just to show out
Makin' noise, my boys so loud
Good dope in the Swish so loud

[Verse 1]
600, my boys so loud
600, my boys so wild
Big MAC with the clip, poke out
Brought bands out just to show out
Brought the bands out just to throw out
These boys ain't got no clout
These boys ain't got no clout
See, I'm all about gettin' this green
See, I'm all about gettin' this guap
I'ma do it all with my team
I'ma do it all for my block
Polo everything, Polo on socks
Big racks, can't pull up my Rocks
Got pounds for the low, come shop
One day, I'ma be a star
One day, I'ma have them cars
And drive them cars with them broke doors (broke doors)
And I smoke loud, and I do drugs
And I get bands, and I get bands, I want more

[Chorus]
Pull up on a bitch so loud
And the watch on my wrist bling-blow
Good dope in the Swish so loud
Ben Frank roll just to show out
Makin' noise, my boys so loud
Good dope in the Swish so loud

[Verse 2]
600, my boys get down
Concert, finna jump in the crowd
Spend a bill every time on loud
Matter fact, finna roll up now
Shot the block up, no mo' rounds
These boys ain't makin' no noise
These boys ain't makin' no sound
He sound like a church mouse
Got bands, I'ma run in his house
I already done fucked his spouse
Them bands all a nigga care about
Everybody wanna bite my swag
Slow down, better read them tags
Niggas talkin' 'bout what they had
Been had that, I'm yo' dad
Got yo' bitch and she finna go down
We up, that's word around town
600, we so loud (so loud)
Be fake, I don't know how
Mean mug, can't show no smile
Can't show no smile (nah)

[Chorus]
Pull up on a bitch so loud
And the watch on my wrist bling-blow
Good dope in the Swish so loud
Ben Frank roll just to show out
Makin' noise, my boys so loud
Good dope in the Swish so loud

[Outro]
Pull up on a bitch so loud
So loud
Yeah, so loud, so loud
So loud, loud
Smokin' dope, man
Let's get it
Lemme hear that shit!
