[Intro: L'A Capone]
L'A!

[Verse 1: L'A Capone]
We play for keeps
The whole hood know me
No new niggas, they ain't on the block, making guap, tryna feed the team
Got a muh'fuckin' dot, no circle
Big .30 hanging out, no curfew
One call
Yeah, Booka gon' murk you
Sneak dissing, man, that's gon' hurt you
Oh, yeah, we taking shit
Steady runnin' from the Jakes and shit (Fuck the Jakes!)
When we reach the top, we can stop doing this basic shit
'Cause I'll ride or die for my niggas
I'd get crucified for my niggas
You'll never see a one on one, fuck boy
The whole squad gon' get you (Squad)
These niggas so phony, though
They'll act like ya homie, though
'Til they see some bands, but it ain't ya mans
He just bail like Romeo (Oh yeah)
And I'm still by the corner sto' (Squad)
Fuck all this rapping, bro
Might think it's a concert and get beyond hurt 'cause we clapping, hoe (Boom, boom)
Now roll that dope shit
On the block, we smoking shit
And niggas die 'cause the cops come quicker than a motherfucking doctor, shit
It's one thing I never did
And that's love a bitch
'Cause I'm drillin' shit
I only love my clique
My O.G. told me to slow down
I see a opp then he get blowed down
Take him down then smoke his whole pound
Aw, they deep, huh?
Empty the round
Get caught, but I won't make a sound
But it's dead 'cause I'm shooting outta town
We sell green and white, but no brown
I'm finna bust a sell right now
These niggas ain't really in the field
Lil Folks going in for the kill
Late night, tryna creep with the steel
Shondale, how that hot shit feel?
And I love when I'm off that pill
Can't change
Boy, I'm too real
They say real niggas don't say they real
Well, fuck nigga, I'm real
And if he can't break bread, he fake
I had one mo' buck on my plate
It was me and bro, we was in the sto'
And both of us got fifty cent cakes
A bitch can't tell me she late
The condoms I use don't break
We at the starting point of this race shit
We gon' win, nigga, I can't wait!

[Interlude: RondoNumbaNine]
Taking off, let's get it!
L'A, what up, bro? (Steve Drive)
A lot of shooters— (L'A Capone in the cut!)
Tay 600 up them Rugers
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it! (L'A Capone fuck 'em up!)

[Verse 2: RondoNumbaNine]
Rondo'll gamble with ya soul (Rondo)
GDK, fuck a Brick, get exposed (GDK)
In the hood strapped up, bunch of poles (Strapped)
Jakes snatch me up and you know I can't fold
600, free my nigga D. Rose (600)
All these hoes kinda getting too old (Let's get it)
I ain't playing no lover games with them lover gangs
Niggas getting smoked (Bow!)
Yeah, it's a lot of shooters on my squad
Yeah, it's a lot of shooters on my squad
And if he holding on that work, he getting robbed
TEC on my neck, I don't need a bodyguard
These niggas be crazy
These niggas don't tote
These niggas think it's a joke
Let me see a opp, I'ma blow (Grr-grr)
See a lot of niggas say I changed
'Cause Rondo done made a lil change
I still claim the set I claimed
And I ain't going, try to take my chain
D Block, free my nigga M-Thang
Steve Drive, that's my campaign
And I will never switch, that just don't exist
'Cause that's blood on my name
Yeah, I'm a shooter, bitch
Tay 600 up them Rugers quick
Deadbeat pops got raised by the block
I was tryna make it flip
He was probably with his moms
He was probably on the porch
Since a youngin', bitch, I been that nigga
I was blowing a torch
You—you know how I rock, nigga
They—they know how I rock, nigga
Cdai got twenty-two shots
Add eight mo', that's a mop, nigga
Niggas do all that talk
My niggas don't come from that cloth
Whack a opp, they can take that lost
600, bitch, Rondo the boss

[Outro: RondoNumbaNine]
Let's get it!
Let's get it!
Bang
A lot of shooters (In the cut!)
Free D. Rose, he fuck 'em up
Let's get it!
Squad, 600, bang
