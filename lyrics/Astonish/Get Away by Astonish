It's a Born Ready Production

[Intro Hook]
So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane
I could be your escape

Say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane
I could be your esc... [2xs]

[Verse 1]
Uhh, and im still chasing my dreams/
Cuz im everything i believe/
I really can't say to follow my lead/
Still standing tall like Hakeem/
A nigga got mad bills shits mad real and u…

Where the advil, where the advil/
Dont stress cuz it can kill/
Life done did a whole 360 like a bad deal/
Now and then i kinda wonder how being the man feel/
Still ballin like the bench mob
Im a beast boy so any diss record better discard/
Just me about a ounce away from being drug free
Nigga I’m still smoking/
The blunts too short like a nigga from Oakland
I hit one time and a nigga still choking/
Thats my word/
Nigga thats my word
U smoke better pass them herbals/
No squares up in my circle
No…and u say u wanna

[Verse 2]

They ain't gotta kno a thang thats need to kno/
I just kno one thang we need to grow/
And u kno i brought all this weed to blow
Where the haters at i dont even kno/
I’m…just…a, lil real nigga/
Just a man in the land where they kill niggas/
Just a man wit a plan, and the plan is to win/
From the start to the end imma go so hard
Wit the pad wit the pen/
From the land of the wind
Imma go iLL and thats fo’real/
Even if i got no deal
U better ease up i dont freeze up i got no chill
