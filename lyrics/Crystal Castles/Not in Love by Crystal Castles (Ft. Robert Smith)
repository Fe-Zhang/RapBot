[Verse 1]
I saw your picture
Hanging on the back of my door
Won't give you my heart
No one lives there anymore
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
Cause it's hot inside
Is that not enough?

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Verse 2]
Could it be that
Time has taken its toll?
Won't take you so far
I am in control
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
Cause it's hot inside
Is that not enough?

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Bridge]
(And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again
Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
Cause it's hot inside
Is that not enough?)

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Outro]
We are not in love
We are not in love
We are not in love
We are not in love
We are not in love
