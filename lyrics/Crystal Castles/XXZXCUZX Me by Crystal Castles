We can insist on havoc
Bring it to us
Pleasure our insides
You said "leave me for dead"
How can your love program the head?

We get so demonstrated
Nuts and bolts for granted
Run along like a dog
As your bodies fall apart

Robotic love
I'm programmed to run
AIDs robot is grinding iron bolts
Robot hunks have one agenda:
They want to play with my placenta
Are we love deserving
When our cyborg parts are burning?

I know we're just diseased appliances
Where will you live?
What will you die for?
Sex is killing me

Baby, I know
Wrong time
Wrong place
Wrong fucking race
Just because we don't feel flesh
Doesn't mean we don't fear death
