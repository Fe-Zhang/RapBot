{Intro:Misty}
Everything's good. Everything's good

{Red Dogg}
Ain't no stoppin, it's on & poppin. Red Dogg, yeah I keep the bunnies hoppin
Don't quit on the microphone I spit & spat, so get wet cause I get it like that
GO/HEAD act like ya knew, that I'm black infact & I'm staying true
GO/HEAD now feel the bass as my homie POP spit to ya face

{Mr.P}
As I spit to your face, burning eyes like Mace. Pump your fist in the air as I take
Your mind to another journey another level. Raisin up got my grip on the shevel
Diggin them up, diggin them up. Sittin them up for the groove, you better not move. Raising them up, raising them up in the hood

{Chorus x 2:Goldie & Misty}
Everything's good, in the hood tonight. The homies got the sack, to make me feel alright. It's all good, so everybody sing. I'm talking on the Jay, cause it ain't no thang. It's all good, it's all good tonight. You'll never catch me slippin, cause I feel alright. It's all good, it's all good tonight. You'll never catch me slippin, cause my game is tight. (x2)

{Misty}

Everything's. Everything's Good (x3)

{Red Dogg}
I'll be God Damn, it's a dirty shame. tip that cup funked up again
Now I'm tore up Bitch! Cause my friend through up & do it all over again
I GET LOADED, like every day, weed to the brain, straight blowed away
I GET LOADED, and I'll never choke, as I lay back & blow a little smoke

{Mr.P}
Pass the joy on down, look around one time. Keep the mist in the air recline
You'll find the mastermind einstein, blow a little smoke in the air one time
Feel me black, you know it's all good. Fat dub sack, getting blazed in da hood
Is it really like that? Is it really so phat? You know that

{Chorus x 2}

{Misty}
Everything's good (x5)
