[Chorus: Raquel Gomez]
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out, somehow my life's gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep, please Lord now take my soul away

[Verse 1: Red Dogg]
Now I'm all alone
Sittin' in my room in a corner
Starrin' at the wall and I'm wishing I was on a
Mission but I'm fishin' in an empty bowl
Cocaine got my brain and I'm sweatin' 'cause I'm ice cold
Hold, on for a minute what's that sound
Raise up to my feet
Paranoid lookin' all around
Up down on the ground, is it reality?
Damn, I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
Now let me find another plan, lookin' for a plot
Lookin' for the man with the sack to get got
Shot, lay him down
'cause it don't be makin' me none
Cocaine on my brain and I gotta get me some

[Chorus: Raquel Gomez]
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out, somehow my life's gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep, please Lord now take my soul away

[Verse 2: Mr. P]
Another mystery
Sittin' in another room at twelve noon
I hope something happen soon
I'm crawlin'
Still burning my knee
At 45 degrees, saying please let it be
Something
In a form of a rock, I can't stop
Because the spot getting hot tick tock
I see the devil clearer in my past, it can't last
Because I'm running out of cash
A stash I remember
From December, my mind gone blank
And it could have been November
Now, as I feel myself blink
I look at the world one time and then I think

[Chorus: Raquel Gomez]
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out, somehow my life's gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep, please Lord now take my soul away
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take away my life, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out, somehow my life's gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep, please Lord now take my soul away

[Bridge: Raquel Gomez]
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take away my life, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take away my life, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I know that you know that I'm living real trife
So lay down that pipe and pick back up your life
Just take it away, please God just take it away
Won't you just give another day to me?

[Chorus: Raquel Gomez]
I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out, somehow my life's gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep, please Lord now take my soul away

I'm so strung out and now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away, dear God, or will you pull me through?
I'm so strung out, somehow my life's gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep, please Lord now take my soul away
