[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
They call me Scrap but when I rap Donmillion
Don't get it wrong I sing straped but I love that Jon
And I got a crunk song but its not from Lil' Jon this is (Dramatic Trax)
Got this from my nigga in Vaughan
I don't need them keys, I'm crunk
And I'm ridin 'round like I'm slangin drunk
So anything that you want
Nigga fuck around imma bang and dump
When you in my habitat them tings like a rat-a-tat
It's yours it don't matter black
When I'm done wit it nigga you can have it back
Wait until this song finish we gonna get it on in dis
You've been rappin for that paper (shit) you in the wrong business
Nope..this is not a dis yup.. I know we started dis
But you ain't as hot as this....
(straight) You know who da hottest is
All my ladies grab yea tits
Let that nigga know your not a bitch
All my niggas grab your dicks
Bounce up and down like you gotta piss
All my niggas be head huntin
All my niggas be lead dumpin
Reason why you dead, frontin
All because you said sumtin

[Chorus]
We from the dot but it's dirty, lights out
You see the rocks and jewellery be iced out
You on my block and you ain't worthy ya lights out
It's T-Dot bitch you don't know what sheist bout (shit) (T-Dot)

Represent your Set Set Represent your Set Set
East side west side Represent your Set Set

[Verse 2]
They say I'm to cocky yeah I'm the same Schott (you know)
Your flows like hockey, have you seen your games stop (get it)
You can call my papi the way that cane chop (got it)
Like sports in jail yeah I got the game locked
Y'all niggas know I slang rocks, yall niggas know I bang Glocks
And y'all ain't got no arms just like tank-tops
D's no ready name?? 'Cause you squeeze and bang that flame
And like christmas nigga
I'm the one that bought that trees and the candy cane
And I got the gifted gab and I got that fif to grab
And I got that kid to stab cuz I push my whips wit mags
I be stackin a lot of dough, lot of crack and a lot of blow
I be smackin a lot of hoes what you lack is a hotter flow
This for my t-dot niggas who know that tuck dat fo' in the waist
This for my t-dot niggas who know that fucked that hoe in the face
I don't really wanna bust that K
You don't really wanna duck that straight
I don't really wanna fuck with jay
But what more can I fuckin say

[Chorus 2X]
We from the dot but it's dirty, lights out
You see the rocks and jewellery be iced out
You on my block and you ain't worthy ya lights out
It's T-Dot bitch you don't know what sheist bout (T-Dot)

[Chorus 2X]
Represent your Set Set Represent your Set Set

East side west side Represent your Set Set

North side south side Represent your Set Set (T-Dot)
