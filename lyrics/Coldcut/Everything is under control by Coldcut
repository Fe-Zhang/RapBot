Get your rock n' roll!
Get it under control
Right now it's time...
To get up and get what's on!
Weeeeell-
Everything is Under Control!
Get on up!
Aw baby, you got to get down
That's right
Everything is Under Control!
I've got to sort
What's under control!
Television incision on our frontal lobe
Capitalism: our mind control
You know Big Brother ain't a TV show!
It's how we roll with what they know
Reality bites me comfortably
Inducing you into watching me watching you watching we
Methodically
Panoptic sheep stay sleepin', peepin'
MK Ultra Vulture suckers
Kool-Aid acid
Electric pulses
A bay full of pigs
And a sky full of Vulcans
Marylin Manroe swinging with the sultans
Ain't it somethin'?
Money's pumping
But it's all in mode with no production
Murdoch, Potlocks, Top for Consumption
My talks co-opted for sayin' something!
Well
Everything is Under Control!
Get on up!
Aw baby, you got to get down!
Everything is Under Control!
I got to sort
What is Under Control!
Get on up
Tell me what I said
'Cause I'm fed up!
Black helicopter
Knights of Malta
Illuminati partners
Tower topplers
Vatcian tax and the Texas Mafia
Pentagon packed with Lockheed Martin
Nafta, Gatt contact with Martians
Sparkplug jacks with Hitler's offspring
D*** Chaney on smack for a busted O-ring
Everything is Under Control!
Everything is Under Control!
Everything is Under Control!
We capture your soul, baby
It's Under Control!
I said Everything is Under Control!
Aww yeah
Everything is Under Control!
