(Chorus)
Whomsoever dont know best get to know were to cool
Giving them cuts so cold it's true skool
Far from the regular nothin used to
Them kind of style is shock and spruce too
Mind and soul in tune and loose too
(Cooler than, cooler than cool!)

Till a badman, get out! move from here!
Tonight we celebrate like we dont care, you just
Pump your fist and stamp your footsie
If you can't dance just wiggle your tootsie
All nations site from the rebel arrangement
Rebel engagement - peace in the lover!
Calypso dance hall punk step and dub!
New wave old wave genre define

Spitting on the a list we know the line
Its the application of the citation, its the
Iration of the of a gyration, its the
Inclination of them that's inclined to
Keep the thing mine
For tis the bigger picture
Biblical decendants scribes a new scripture
Articulation of the incantation is the
Foundation of the emancipation

(Chorus)
Mind weight ready warped
Roads of many sign distraction
Many find time for tubby bye bye
Me oh my my oh me
Tis it so simplistic
Child's play man's play
Could it be sadistic?
Head space locked in them plastic gods
There's too much! there's too many reasons!
To keep deceiving
To keep on believing in the
Oh blah ra ra the sloganeers
The crocodile pain, the crocodile tears
She dont really need that brand new nose
And he dont really need slave shoes or slave clothes
But were far too busy to keep our mind privy
Too the blessed is the man and the
Grammar the host ease

Ready to receive the rich a cold breeze
All we really need is to plant the god seed
Something to live for
Something to believe

(Chorus)
