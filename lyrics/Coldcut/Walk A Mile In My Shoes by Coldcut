If I could be you
And you could be me
For just one hour

If we could find a way
To get inside
Each other's minds

If you could see you
Through my eyes
Instead of your ego

I believe you'd be
Surprised to see
That you've been blind

Walk a mile in my shoes (x2)
And before you abuse, criticise and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now the whole world
You see around you
Is just a reflection

And the law of Karma
Says you reap
Just what you sew

So unless you've lived a life
Of total perfection
You'd better be careful of every stone
That you should throw

Walk a mile in my shoes (x2)
And before you abuse, criticise and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Walk a mile in my shoes (x2)
And before you abuse, criticise and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Walk on, come on
In my shoes

Walk a mile in my shoes...(x4)
