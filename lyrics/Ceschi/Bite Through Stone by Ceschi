[Verse 1]
For every bicycle in China there's a
Cryogenically frozen embryo
That will
Wake up in a cold sweat
Run around the veteran's hospital
Wondering what gave birth to it
Then we'll sing the national anthem
While the government rounds up zygotes
In the latest titanium nets
So they will keep their baby mouths shut
And suck down freedom with the other runts

[Refrain 1]
But I'm an impostor here
I feel it in my bones
And in the way that I have never cared
About American hope
Yes, you're an anomaly just like me
So let's fuck in the street
To show them what it's like to be free

[Chorus]
You'll give birth on a highway
With fifty frozen babies on all sides
Curled up in their ice cube wombs
Sweet, closed eyed
We'll come up with their names one by one
Till every letter's used
And they've thawed out in the sun

[Verse 2]
Then we can sharpen swords in sync with local textile workers
And sew together sinew for our injured ally warriors
Building in solidarity beneath coniferous giants
Planning to shove spikes into the backs of sleeping tyrants
The subtleties of war are loud and so obnoxious
That they can shake stem cells out of test tubes and leave the deaf unconscious
Nobody ever taught us the most valuable lesson
Now there's a tragic lack of expression on the faces that we've dissected

[Refrain 2]
We're impostors here
I know it in my soul
I also know that we can rip through the skin of monster's throat
I know that all our knuckles combined can break a mammoth's bones
And all these tiny teeth together can bite through stone
