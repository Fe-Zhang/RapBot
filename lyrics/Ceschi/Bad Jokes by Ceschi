He apologized to the folks in the back row who got splattered in blood at the last show
He apologized for the spit and sweat that dripped off of his skin and his chest, but none the less
He should have apologized for things that he never did when he should, and things that he did when he shouldn't
Of all those sins that gathered up to form a fifty foot dragon sleeping in a labyrinth inside of his brain cavity stagnant
GG Allin threatened to blow out his brains on the stage, but when death day came it was quiet and tame
And there's the one about the girl in Berlin who jumped out a window when her people convinced her suicide was performance

Bad jokes about bad people in bad bars make the bad worse and make the good crash cars
So have you heard the one about the one man band?
I heard he sang like an angel before he hanged
So have you heard the one about the one man band, yes the one man band?
Yeah, I heard it...

But it's too soon to laugh about his follies in the past
About the way that he got fat and couldn't keep it in his pants
And I remember lies about five figure record deals
Headlining bills and lines when he tried to convince me everything was real
But it was a crying shame seeing him lye in pain after realizing the way he wasted time and again
They dangled the prize in front of his tired eyes like arcade toy cranes with no claws to play

He used to sing, "god damn another one of God's bad jokes"
When he stabs and pokes at her last hopes
We were young once, we wrote songs about not giving a fuck, acting like we had some guts
Laughing on a bar stool dumb, drunk, his one hand fiddled with some nuts while the other held the mug
And every crease in his face was a fault line that looked like it had been drawn there at the beginning of time
But he was only 45 when he died with no family left behind, just instruments and a mic
And the story goes that he cried like a baby as he tied the noose waiting for someone to come and save him
