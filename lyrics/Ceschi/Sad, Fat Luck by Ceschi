[Intro]
There are some moments I want to forget
Like the night I broke your heart in Vegas, I regret
Everything's costing an arm and a leg
But your loss has been the biggest expense yet
I've seen so many souls come and go
From this world that my heart has grown bitter and cold
Running away from the inevitable is stupid, I know this
Reality is a kick in the face but I'm hoping to focus
Running away from the inevitable is stupid, I know this
But I've been beating up all my demons with both fists

[Verse 1]
Another back is stabbed
Back to back deaths and casual sex
Acting happy while actually depressed
Paint that clown face on for the audience
They'll sing along to songs about your illness
Realize I never gave a fuck about success
But this is the only job that I can still get before I'm past tense
That's word to my dead friends
Each night feels like it might be my last show
My fans party on blow while I'm crying, old and sober
Trapped inside their iPhone photo folders
With those ghosts of Christmas past
And laughs from back before good times were over
Turn on the autopilot and my answer is "No, no!"
Dangle a carrot in front of me, fuck that
"Yes, Yes!" Yoko Ono, get that?
Thought about sleeping on bridges in Europe
But tired of living the life of an ex-pat loner
My body is here, but I'm dying to go home
Wishing that I could feel love again
But I've been out of control and solo

[Chorus]
Everything's costing an arm and a leg
And a heart and a head
I'm ready for anything
Waiting for this to end
Everything's costing an arm and a leg
And a heart and a head
I'm ready for anything

[Verse 2]
The glory on stage don't last enough
Night after night still trying to catch that rush
They're watching me hang myself for rounds of applause
Back in your town again like a half-assed Santa Claus
With bags of merch at a truck stop
Whistling Christmas tunes at the gas pump
Feel like Pat and wanna quit rap and punk
Half my friends are dead
From tragic accidents, bad habits and madness
And the other half's locked up
If I'm ever done from an airplane crash or drugs
Just call it what it was mufucka that sad, fat luck
Yeah, that's sad, fat luck
If you've gotta ask, "What's love?" That's sad, fat luck
If you're in a casket young, that's sad, fat luck
And if you can't stand this song, here's half a fuck

[Verse 3]
Been inhibited by the fact that I'm miserable
And I don't got any particular vision of living to build
In the middle of critical minutes wishing to feel
The finish of quitting my physical
When the moments were difficult
It's ridiculous being so fucking overly cynical
Insignificant, trivial, when I'm really seeking pivotal change
Sickening to be acting like a typical man
Don't remember the women that I've been sticking my dick into
Fully faking the funk and I feel the fucking is pitiful
What's the apple I bit into?
Is the worm or the apple more sinful?
Man, I've been faking the funk and I feel the fucking is pitiful

[Bridge]
Run, Lola, run, fast as you can
Please start again, I got the bends
Somebody fix my Radiohead
Without guns, without meds
Run, Lola, run, fast as you can
Please start again, I got the bends
Somebody fix my Radiohead
Without guns, without meds

[Verse 3 - Reprise]
Been inhibited by the fact that I'm miserable
And I don't got any particular vision of living to build
In the middle of critical minutes wishing to feel
The finish of quitting my physical
When the moments were difficult

[Verse 4]
In reality I love you too much
To want to be dragging you through mud
In a NeverEnding Story horse's death
I'm forced to rest
Like oldest tortoises or crying Orbison
Divorce your gorgeousness
The most important things have been written then torn to shreds Still mourn and wish that I was born equipped
It hurts us both, I think
Like growth of bones, it stings

[Outro]
Everything's costing an arm and a leg
And a heart and a head
I'm ready for anything
Waiting for this to end
Everything's costing an arm and a leg
And a heart and a head
Everything's costing an arm and a leg
And a heart and a head
