[Intro]
From the East to the South to the West to the North
Come on Al' Tariq, go off and go off!
A yes yes y'all, freak freak y'all
So unique y'all, Al' Tariq y'all

[Verse 1: Al' Tariq]
I dusted off the .44 chrome, threw my Nike hat on the dome
Plus pack the celly phone, left out my home alone
To roam these wicked streets in the U.S. of A
See no matter where you at, motherfucking crime pay
But not my way, put them days of slinging behind me
Now I rock spots where only rap fiends can find me
And that remind me, can't forget my 1-800 beeper
So I can keep a eye on my mida mida
Now, loaded up my shit in this van to tour America
I'm out to get this cheese and to see every area
Of every city, every corner and back street
Thought shit would be calm like that cover of BlackSTREET
Wrong impression, from the beginning, we get to sinning
All up and down the East coast yo, we banging women
The Beatnuts and Common Sense is steady trucking
Got chickens sucking, raw dog we steady fucking
But out luck in this game runs out through the Carolinas
Deep in the woods, niggas licking off behind us
Glad they didn't find us, glad we didn't get tackled
Thought brothers only played for keeps up in the Apple

[Hook]
All around the world they sling rocks and lick shots
Everywhere you go, same thing, connect the dots
(Think not!)
Stop what you thinking, stop all that fussing
The shit is all the same and that's the point of this discussion
All around the world they sling rocks and lick shots
Everywhere you go, same thing, connect the dots
(Think not!)
Stop what you thinking, stop all that fussing
The shit is all the same and that's the point of this discussion

[Verse 2: Al' Tariq]
Now Common knew this chick that lived deep in 'ouisiana
A thick ass and shit, but she sleep with Peaseyanna
B.E. and Anna, and every other ho, what is it
So we made our visit short, blew like a blizzard
We on our way now, OK now we headed
To good ol' Tex' and all gun shit get deaded
Cause down here, niggas don't fear a good ol' shoot-em-up
They love to suit 'em up, so don't try to .32 'em up
Even my big .44 don't scare no more
I hear gunshots, son son hit the floor
I get my dough, I'm out, did my show, I scout
For some ho-ass, I need some more ass on my route
No doubt, avoiding hexes, floating through Texas
Stackin them checkses, gets me a beaming Lexus
Now next is the state of Cali-forn-I-A
My word is bond-I-A to Cali-forn-I-A
But I represent the Q and you knew, whole hearted
That I'd be trooping through with crew so don't get started
Or get smarted, by the certified black sheep
Al' Tariq, now let's troop West to East, cause

[Hook]
All around the world they sling rocks and lick shots
Everywhere you go, same thing, connect the dots
(Think not!)
Stop what you thinking, stop all that fussing
The shit is all the same and that's the point of this discussion
All around the world they sling rocks and lick shots
Everywhere you go, same thing, connect the dots
(Think not!)
Stop what you thinking, stop all that fussing
The shit is all the same and that's the point of this discussion

[Verse 3: Al' Tariq]
Now peep the way we slid in to Colorado
Where my bravado, had 'em screaming cause I'm that macho
That top honcho, banging bodies like I'm Camacho
Hitting notes like Pavarotti, caught this hottie, bang that body
Saw the shottie on this gang nigga, and he was focused
Then I spot his crew swarming through like they was locusts
? know this ain't his spot, so I bag up the shorts
Unloose my Eddie Bauer jeans, adjust my Polo Sports
I got this jigga for some slicing but no blasting material
Just wish I had that chrome .44 without the serial
Number, so I can give him slumber
Vaporize these niggas holding triggers yo I coulda put him under
But no time to wonder, it's getting tight up in this piece
Took honey by her hand, to my van, so we headed East
Now is you with me? Or you gon' stay out here and freeze
With all these motherfucking trees and the snow up to your knees
So what's your answer sister? Next stop, the Windy City
She said, "Yeah I don't care, but 'Riq would you lick my
Kitty-kat?" Hon I can do that, hop in the van
But before I ever can, yo you gotta see my man
Now here we go go, to At-lan-ta
Through with La-na, puffing lye, gettin high
Alright? Chi-Town, we hit ground, we headed South
To the side, four corner hustlers is in the house
Woo woo woo woo, we kicking script, about our journey
Make shorty hit the road, got no dough for no attorney
Plus she didn't burn me, I guess I'm lucky this time
But the next time I wind strictly dick and rubbers combined

[Hook]
All around the world they sling rocks and lick shots

Stop what you thinking, stop all that fussing
The shit is all the same and that's the point of this discussion
All around the world they sling rocks and lick shots
Everywhere you go, same thing, connect the dots

Stop what you thinking, stop all that fussing
