[Intro: Al' Tariq]
In the name of Allah...
Al' Tariq...
Yaadan Abdullah...
God Connect y'all...

[Verse 1: Psycho Les]
Straight out the ruggedest streets
We bless you with the ruggedest beats
To bang speakers through the metro, got you petro
Once my Tec blow, hollows at your project though
Your heartbeat go from Taana Gardner to techno music
Especially the old live music
Chop it and make hits and bounce in a getaway Buick
With a forty ounce, between the laps
Making cream off raps, we display kinda this way

[Verse 2: Al' Tariq]
I bust these chickens like they clips, live fat as Jimmy Walker
The stalker, strictly smooth-talking native New Yorker
Straight out the Q-Boro, my shit thorough
Like ki's of uncut, raw nut up in your gut
Say what, say what, say what?
My blue steel lethal plus my peoples
We rolling two deep, there ain't no equal
Ain't no sequel to this horrifying, stars are dying
I peeped you in that show nigga so stop your lying

[Hook]
You're fronting (you ain't saying nothing)
(Yo we steady hitting home runs kid while you be bunting)
Who are we? Beatnuts!
Puffing la la, got this game on lock
Competition ha ha...
Who are we? Beatnuts!
Puffing la la, got this game on lock
Competition ha ha...

[Verse 3: Al' Tariq]
I'm cold blooded as a matter of fact we shackin
With the slack, and pumping them kids that live in Staten
Combatting, these individges that burn they bridges
Come on our street and we greet you with the feet nigga

[Psycho Les]
All these wannabe drug dealer rappers, come on
Steps in my zone and get clapped like a pawn
Gun you and run you off the avenue
Once you crash I'mma tackle you... (what?)
Empty out your pocks, out to get my fat knots
Like a gas attendant, making presidentes
(Presidentes, dead presidentes, presidentes...)

[Juju]
A-yo reality's really the individual's mentality
Some seek eternal life, while others seek fatality
It's sad to see young niggas born to die tragically
New York got a nigga fucked up, and living savagely
I'd rather be building cause ignorance is like drilled in
Niggas'll feed they ego but they won't feed they children
But still then, you see 'em in the club
Moet'n it, forgetting it, acting like Allah ain't sweating it

[Hook]
You're fronting (you ain't saying nothing)
(Yo we steady hitting home runs kid while you be bunting)
Who are we? Beatnuts!
Puffing la la, got this game on lock
Competition ha ha...
Who are we? Beatnuts!
Puffing la la, got this game on lock
Competition ha ha...

[Verse 4: Al' Tariq]
Was the above par at the Shark Bar, like an all-star
And laughing, cause all of these chicks thinking I'm Fashion
They out of focus, smoking jokers
Won't see the raw to the deal less I peel out with the steel cause
I see the sucker emcees fall
And the beauty of it all
When the 'Nuts come shining through, yeah

[Ju-Ju]
Yo peep the presentation, we dealing with innovation
Junkyard shit stay up in heavy rotation
Intimidation, seem to be your key factor
I'm pushing all that shit back punk, like a tractor
