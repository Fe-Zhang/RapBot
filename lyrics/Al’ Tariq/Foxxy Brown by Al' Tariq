[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemens.. all the way live.. from the Q
Al' Tariq, look, look

[Verse 1]
I'm round 135th, thirty-three thirty-three
Cuz-o crib, where all them greasy dirties be
Niggas, gettin them evil papes and it don't matter
Whether you brother or sister take you out fo' the batter
AIGHT? So check the scene, we in front of the build'
Me, Spud and Berg tossin grills hittin Phil's and then
Out of nowhere, look what I see steppin in our direction
Body definitely kept in
The best shape that's possible, and yo it's probable
That I could bag her, I'm fiendin to have her
I tap her, what's yo' name lovely?
Body's bone-crushin, some Pam Grier shit and right there
She started blushin so you know how I'm thinkin peep the drama
We gon' slide up to my crib and continue like some karma(?)'s
Black momma, not no white momma, I got the right momma
Got this sexy brown momma

[Chorus]
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"

[Verse 2]
Look, I was like the Mack, to her Foxxy Brown
_Cotton Comes to Harlem_ gettin this money Uptown
"Showtime at the Apollo," games up at the Rutgers
All eyes on, we just some fly muh'fuckers
Got these suckers live in fear we like three the hard way
Me Fox and cuz-o Spud we just feed the hard way
Just creamin all day, plus my clan's all in it
We not just tryin to run it, nigga we tryin to win it
And since we killin in it, you know here come the leaches
Lookin fo' they share, blowin shit like some speakers
But my boo is my keeper, you know she gon' protect me
Ms. Cleopatra Jones, she never let 'em get me
She never let 'em sweat me, keep the joint nearby
Cause of my Fox Brown all these niggas fear I
All hail Tariq and the long black missus
Breakin niggas off and just handlin our business
Foxxy Brown

[Chorus]
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"

[Verse 3]
Now look - here comes the scandal, to crush my empire
Make my empire, burn with the fire
From the joint cuz-o hits the deck
Now look at that, they just left the fam wet
I get the soldiers, round up the posse
We on some Panther shit, fuck Gucci and Gotti
Fuck a Maseratti, we up in the Land
Now I'm out here at war and Fox is at my right hand
Do some "Black Ceasar" shit throw a nigga in the trunk
With the rats got the bats, in case he alive when we get back
Now how's that for a twist on the story
Me and this hot thang goin down with the glory
Steady puffin lye gettin "Cooley High" we never die
Blow up the high, niggas scheme but never try, "Superfly"
Fo' the nine-ohs and eight-five-ohs
Me and my bitch, now that's just how the shit goes
Fox Brown

[Chorus]
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
"I want a down hoe, a Foxxy Brown hoe, I want a down hoe.."
"She sho' is BAD!"
