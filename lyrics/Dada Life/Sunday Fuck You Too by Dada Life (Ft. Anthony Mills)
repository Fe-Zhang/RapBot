[Verse 1]
My boss said "Hey
Tonight you're working late
'Cause you got stuff to do"
Everyday's the same, there's nothing new
Everyday somebody's screaming
Hey
Feels like I can't escape
But I know what to do
Now I'm leaving and I'm screaming too
And now everybody's screaming

[Chorus]
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Sunday, fuck you too
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Sunday, fuck you too

[Verse 2]
My friends said "Hey
Tonight we stay out late
'Cause we got stuff to do"
Keep on smiling, everything is new
Everybody in the place go
Hey
This is the great escape
And we know what to do
This is the song that we are screaming to
And now everybody's screaming

[Chorus]
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Sunday, fuck you too
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

[Bridge]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Sunday, fuck you too!

[Chorus]
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Sunday, fuck you too
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
No, I don't care about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Sunday, fuck you too

[Outro]
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
I don't care about you
