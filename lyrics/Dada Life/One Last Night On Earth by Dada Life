[Verse 1]
Streets that have no name
All the lights are turned down low
And the night's here for us
Calling of the wild
From the space inside ourselves
We are ready, the chosen ones

[Chorus]
Thousand miles away
Light is on it's way
Leave the day behind
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
Breaking down the wall
Everything will fall
Leave yourself behind
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth

[Verse 2]
Echoes from the past
All the friends we loved and lost
At the feel, where it all began
Children of the bleat
Let the 303 be free
We are ready, the beautiful ones

[Chorus]
Thousand miles away
Light is on it's way
Leave the day behind
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
Breaking down the wall
Everything will fall
Leave yourself behind
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
One last night on Earth
