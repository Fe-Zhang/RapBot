Fault the Police
Freedom is a state of mind
A mind is a state of being
Stay the Fuck out of my mind and my being
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run got ‘um on a short leash (x3)
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run, they defy and they decease
I don’t cry when the police die cause they probably deserved it
Run around with a badge and a gun
And they god damn fuck with everyone
Enforce rules made by fools
Violence and fear there tools
They dress to impress with there laws they arrest
And they leave us powerless
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run got ‘um on a short leash (x3)
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run, they defy and they decease
We have created a reality based on fear where a terrorist a gangster or a police can take away our freedom or your sense of security at any time
I don't cry when a Gangster dies cause he probably deserved it
They run around with a bag and a gun
And they god damn fuck with everyone
Enforce rules made by fools
Violence and fear there tools
They dress to impress thinking fear is respect
And they leave us powerless
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run got ‘um on a short leash (x3)
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run, they defy and they decease
A society that incarcerates there own population for any minor infraction where there is 100's upon 1000's of pages and pages of laws and reason for the district attorney and the local jurisdiction and the justice system to put its entire force of removing an individual from his family connection and make him separate from the tribal earth
I don’t cry when a terrorist dies cause he probably deserved it
Run around with a bomb and a gun
And they god damn fuck with every one
Enforce rules made by fools
Violence and fear there tools
Bombs fall from the sky
And a mom as she cries as she watches her baby die
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run got ‘um on a short leash (x3)
I don’t fault the police
Cause the people that run, they defy and they decease
