[Blueprint]

It's my time, I'm 'bout to blow
You slept first, but now you know
The rap game, a thousand clones
All worried about their clothes
I used to chill at my home, now I’m all about the road
Moving, locking down the shows, hit the tele, count the dough
Shake hands, make plans, rent vans, make fans
God damn, this is how a little boy became a man
You want the fame and all the riches, big name model bitches
But you don’t want to hustle twice as hard to try to get it
You got a lot to whine about. While you talking, wilding out, I’m posted outside the club, working passing flyers out
What’s Print's life about? The same thing I rhyme about
Make good music and give my fans something to smile about
You ought to try it out, we like to call it honesty
It's the best policy, the reason why they follow me
My reputation precedes me, the rap game needs me
Cause I do the impossible, but I make it look easy
Now all the underdogs wanna take shots at my figure
Cause I’m eating real big and didn’t invite them to dinner
You wasn’t there when I put it in the oven. So when it's time to break bread, cousin, don’t ask me for nothin'
Everybody got a rhyme, if not a rhyme they got a beat
If not ki's of cocaine, they all packing heat
So what they really telling me when they ain’t outselling me?
And everything they say and do is fueled by their jealousy
I know you're trying to politic, and I'm only involved with it
So you can get in the game, take the ball and then run with it
They tried to hit me with the same thing that you fell for
"Make it more commercial, Print
You probably would sell more"
But I’m eating now, so I’m like, "What the hell for?"
Telling me to change only makes me rebel more
But radio don’t want that, Print don’t fit the format
Tell dude to change it up, and maybe he can come back
I made this in my basement when you wasn’t even there
To express my feelings, not to be played on the air
So am I wrong or secure if I really don’t care
If this ever turns into something that anybody hears
Man, I’m an artist, these other dudes shook
I write my album on my sidekick – no paper, no notebooks
Then rhyme for five minutes straight
With no breaks and no hooks
No punch-lines, no similes, so I'm easy to overlook
But Grooveshack, Theives World, Expo, Scribble Jam
I’ve been around in every single era and I'm still the man
And while I may not get the same hype as the next man
Everything in my life is going according to His plan
So thank God for every fan, every single listener
Who told me to make the art, you don't gotta switch it up
You put it out, we'll pick it up. Do you, stay strong
You're the main reason we don’t turn our radios on
