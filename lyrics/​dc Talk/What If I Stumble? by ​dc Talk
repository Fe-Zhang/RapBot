[Intro: Brennan Manning]
The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today
Is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips
Then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle
That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable

What if I stumble?
What if I fall?

[Verse 1]
Is this one for the people?
Is this one for the Lord?
Or do I simply serenade
For things I must afford?
You can jumble them together
My conflict still remains
Holiness is calling
In the midst of courting fame

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause I see the trust in their eyes
Though the sky is falling
They need Your love in their lives
Compromise is calling

[Chorus]
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
What if I lose my step
And I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue
When my walk becomes a crawl?
What if I stumble
And what if I fall?

[Post-Chorus 1]
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
You never turn in
The heat of it all
What if I stumble
What if I fall?

[Verse 2]
Father please forgive me
For I cannot compose
The fear that lives within me
Or the rate at which it grows
If struggle has a purpose
On the narrow road you've carved
Why do I dread my trespasses
Will leave a deadly scar

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do they see the fear in my eyes?
Are they so revealing?
This time I cannot disguise
All the doubt I'm feeling

[Chorus]
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
What if I lose my step
And I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue
When my walk becomes a crawl?
What if I stumble
And what if I fall?

[Bridge]
What if I stumble?
Everyone's got to crawl
And you know that
You're up against a wall
It's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl
And you know that

Everyone's got to crawl
And you know that
You're up against a wall
It's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl
And you know that

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I hear You whispering my name
(You say)
My love for You will never change
(Never change)

[Chorus]
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
What if I lose my step
And I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue
When my walk becomes a crawl?
What if I stumble
And what if I fall?

[Chorus]
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
What if I lose my step
And I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue
When my walk becomes a crawl?
What if I stumble
And what if I fall?

[Post-Chorus 2]
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
You never turn in
The heat of it all
What if I stumble
What if I fall?
You are my comfort
And my God

Is this one for the people
Is this one for the Lord?
