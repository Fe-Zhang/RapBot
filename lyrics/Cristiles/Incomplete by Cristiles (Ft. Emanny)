[Intro - Emanny]
Money don't mean shit
Money don't mean shit
Money don't mean shit

[Verse 1 - Cristiles]
They tell me that I made it, ha
Must be living the life cause I’m getting famous, ha
Got these new shoes and these new clothes
Parties new money, parties new hoes
But there is something wrong
It doesn’t feel complete
Nights been getting long
Talks been getting cheap
Cause it meant that I'm missing something I never do
But when I’m fucking her all I remember is you

[Chorus 1x 2 - Emanny]
Got a pocket full of money, don’t mean shit
All these bitches love me, don’t mean shit
They tell me that I’m lucky, don’t mean shit
This life with no meaning
This life with no reason
No reason with you

[Verse 2 - Cristiles]
And this new bitch
Who's talking to her other half
She just wants the fame
Thinks that I don't notice that
Ain't no room for love
It's too late for that
No one you can trust, too much fame for that
So when we in that bed
And I give her the D and I hit it hit it
Until she trip and falls asleep
I'm looking at her face and it starts to change
And then I see you and I realize
Fuck the fame

[Chorus 1x 2 - Emanny]
Got a pocket full of money, don’t mean shit
All these bitches love me, don’t mean shit
They tell me that I’m lucky, don’t mean shit
This life with no meaning
This life with no reason
No reason with you

[Outro - Emanny]
No reason with you
No reason with you
Reason with you
Said ...

[Chorus 1x 2 - Emanny]
Got a pocket full of money, don’t mean shit
All these bitches love me, don’t mean shit
They tell me that I’m lucky, don’t mean shit
This life with no meaning
This life with no reason
No reason with you
