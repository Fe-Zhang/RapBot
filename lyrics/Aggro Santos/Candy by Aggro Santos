Hot girl, you're doin' it well
The way your hips move got me under a spell
Right now I don't really care who's watchin'
I wanna dance all night long, no stoppin'

You, you, you, yeah, you
Pretend they're not here just do what you do
I'm a kick back 'cause I got a nice view
Wow, this feels like a déjà vu

Girl, you look familiar, where do I know you from?
Have you been to visit me at aggrosantos.com?
Step into my world, I am sure you want to come
Check my Facebook, I got pictures I'ma give you some, ooh

Ooh, come and getcha some, come and getcha some candy
Ooh, ooh, come and getcha some, come and getcha some candy
Ooh, come and getcha some, come and getcha some candy
Ooh, ooh, come and getcha some, come and getcha candy

Ela e bela, ja era, eu quero da pra ela
Ela e bela, ja era, eu quero da pra ela
Ela e bela, ja era, eu quero da pra ela
Ela e bela, ja era, eu quero da pra ela pronto

A sweet touch comes handy man
Don't be afraid of the candy man
I got a sweet tooth, now I want a sweet girl
And we're straight up, if we do kiss, we do tell

You, you, you, yeah, you
Pretend they're not here just do what you do
I'm a kick back 'cause I got a nice view
Wow, this feels like a déjà vu

Girl, you look familiar, where do I know you from?
Step into my world, I am sure you want to come
Check my Facebook, I got pictures I'ma give you some

Girl, you look familiar, where do I know you from?
The way that this is goin' you are gonna get me sprung
'Cause your love is sweet like candy, and I want me some, ooh
