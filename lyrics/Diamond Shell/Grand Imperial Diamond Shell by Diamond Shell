[Diamond Shell]
Here's a message from the all time great Shelly D
Hittin hard as crack and I suggest you better be
Ready to rock steady, all night Freddy
So bring your sleepin bags, bring your pillows and teddies
Baby yo, I got some shit that just won't quit
And I'ma just rock rhymes until the sky gets lit
Shell is the master of disaster, havoc in ways of rhymin gangsta
Now who said that crime don't pay?
Cash checks for respect, microphones I wreck
Open the rhyme book, and I'll kick the context
If you know what's best, you'll step off or make a (??)
I'm down with John Wayne, Lone Ranger and Tonto
Take your life and step tonight, like the Masked Avenger
Or you dissapear like a magical ninja
I take rappers off like a set of clothes
All wick wack foes just fall like dominoes
The king of royal badness, smooth as candlelight
Doin damage like a vandal handle wars and graffiti sites
I wreck rappers, that's how I get known
My heart is made of stone plus I'm bad to the bone
If you step up to diss 'em son, you'll find on the hum'
That Diamond Shell is not the average bum chum
Slick as oil, gettin straight to the letter black
In rappin you'll never find another who's better at
Beatin rappers down to the ground with a profound sound
And Diamond J spins the records 'round
Yo I'ma rag and tag then I'ma bury you
Step back and clear the path for the Grand Imperial
The Diamond Shell..

[Chorus: various singers]
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!
[m] Whoawhowhoawhowhoawhowhoawho
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] That man is Diamond Shell
[m] Yes he rocks so well
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!

[Diamond Shell]
My tune haunts the room like an old ghost town
And I'ma stick it to ya, I mush your face in the ground
Hittin hard enough, to the damage of a wreckin ball
Once I swing it that's all for you Pah
With the rap I'm fine, walk on very thin lines
Wreck necks for respect, plus I carry a nine
Jack black it's a fact, that my rhymes don't lack
And I never been called wack, so whassup wit dat?
Yo if I'm provoked, then MC's get broke
Yeah I'ma grab 'em by the neck and I'ma start to choke
Bust a move as I float on the track that I wrote
Pull the trigger on a nigga smell the gunsmoke
Yo I'ma rag and tag and I'ma bury you
Step back and clear the path for the Grand Imperial
The Diamond Shell..

[Chorus: various singers]
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!
[m] Whoawhowhoawhowhoawhowhoawho
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] Grand Imperial Diamond Shell
[m] Yes he rocks so well

[Diamond Shell]
I close swift like a narrow, smooth as a sparrow
If mics was a gun then mines would be a double barrel
Step stiff and on up to, while Diamond Shell bust two
Funky fo' funky rhymes, then I would just love to
Express my best, and my best is the last verse
Just when you think you come off you get plastered
S-H-E, double-L spells danger
Take flight for yourself and your health 'fore I hand ya
Slim, trim, stayin covered in gold
Yo the Diamond Shell got soul
Cause I'm the master of disaster, and rhyme techniques
When I speak, sucker MC's knees get weak
Yo they melt like butter with the rhymes I'm utterin
If they speak they stu-stu start stutterin
It's only natural to be nervous when
You're confronted by Shell the grand wizard rhyme champion
I'm slow flow, good to go, do a hoe, also yo
You should know that I'm packin a nine yo
Keep a low pro' when my nine goes bo
Try to play Diamond Shell your new address is death row
So step back, before I bury you
And clear the path for the Grand Imperial
The Diamond Shell..

[Chorus: various singers]
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!
[m] Whoawhowhoawhowhoawhowhoawho
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] That man is Diamond Shell
[m] Yes he rocks so well
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] Diamond Diamond Diamond Diamond
[m] The Grand Imperial Diamond Shell
[m] Yes he rocks so well, yeahyeahyeahhhhhhh
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!
[f] Doo doo doo, Diamond Shell!
[f] Doo doo doo!
