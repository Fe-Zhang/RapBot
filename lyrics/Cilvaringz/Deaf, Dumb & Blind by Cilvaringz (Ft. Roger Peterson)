[Hook: Roger Peterson]
Distorted lies, blurry and faded
People confused, buried and hated
Pick up a stone, you will find Him
Break my bones, only defy Him

[Verse 1: Cilvaringz]
You see like Spliff be to Busta, Jungle be to Nas
Beretta be to RZA, I'm to God
I'll go nutty for His word to be told
To uphold His value above cars, villas and gold
Despite of what you got, done fucked or sold
Your soul will be judged at the end of your road son
Since I was a child at a conscious age
I spoke His name in vain when in rage, trying to
Gain knowledge, as laid to prophets
But it was fake and displayed dishonest
So I conceded to Allah to fight Satan
Teach pagans and diversify Arabians
In the eyes of those victims of the media
Given the image of a threat made it easier
For them to slay us in the eyes of the weak
And justify the war with the lies they speak, c'mon

[Hook: Roger Peterson]
Distorted lies, blurry and faded
People confused, buried and hated
Pick up a stone, you will find Him
Break my bones, only defy Him

[Verse 2: Cilvaringz]
So help us sincerely, our mothers, our fathers
Strengthen our sisters, our cousins, our brothers
Paradise for martyrs, I pray for them truthfully
And for immunity for our communities
Cause Bush is out to rule me and fool me
Offer me his freedom, so he can go free and rob my rubies
Surrounds me with groupies and jubilees
But they will never win, they only win in movies
I write the Eulogy for death has embraced us
And left us faceless and death fearing, faithless
They rather live fearing death will embrace us
Then die fighting the rest of these pagans

[Hook: Roger Peterson]
And when will we rise up?
With a sword in our clutches, fighting injustice?
We rather seek the pleasures and comfort
And kneel down to the laws of a puppet

[Hook: Roger Peterson]
Distorted lies, blurry and faded
People confused, buried and hated
Pick up a stone, you will find Him
Break my bones, only defy Him

[Verse 3: Cilvaringz]
Yo, see my circumference consists of the righteous
And God abundance, Quran readers and devoted Muslims
Who pray 5 times a day, announce their faith
And denounce what the Nation says on Fridays
That's why son I never preach your Lessons
Pay homage to your words in my least of efforts
And from Allah, I seek repentance
That's for myself and you Five Percenters, 'cause yo
His name is but a title to you so called wisemen
Who try to come across civilized and
Supreme to the so called 85s
When will you realize man is man?
Not Allah, stop saying that the black man is God
For certain you have strayed afar
I quote the Quran, awaiting assassination
Knowing Malcolm was killed, saying the same shit

[Hook: Roger Peterson]
Distorted lies, blurry and faded
People confused, buried and hated
Pick up a stone, you will find Him
Break my bones, only defy Him

[Outro: Malcolm X sample]
I'm still a Muslim
My religion is Islam
I ran into some obstacles in the Nation Of Islam
And I feel that I can best serve the honorable Elijah Mohamed's
Purpose and program, and carrying into existence what I feel, I understand
Concerning his objectives better on the outside than I can on the inside
And, and now that I have the independence of action
It's my intention to work with everybody or against everybody
Whatever the case may be. To try and get some kind of a
Mediate solution to the problems that are confronting our people
