[Intro: Bunzi]
Hey baby it's me just calling you to say goodnight and to send you kisses and to tell you I love you, and I miss you
I hope you have a good night tonight
I might try calling again in 20 minutes, but otherwise I'm going to bed alright?
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye bear

[Speak: Eslam Jawaad in classic Arabic]
From the first look, my soul laughed from within as if it knew
That you would be my pillar in this life and the next
It said to me: Oh you fool, speak to her
Lest you lose her 'till after the rising of souls

[Back vocals: Roger Peterson]
I love you...

[Hook: Cilvaringz]
You all that I need I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me I keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, everything about you
On top of that you always real, keep it true, c'mon
You all that I need I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me I keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, everything about you
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu girl

[Verse 1: Cilvaringz]
And so, I saw your eyes and fell in love on the spot
For all beauty was mocked, by your appearance and I
Caught by your fragrance like the wines of Babylon
A strong equality, eyes green like cedars of Lebanon, queen
A king's daughter, bathed in scented waters
Your body caressed by sweet oils, divine woman
You can't even imagine what I feel for you, I'll kill for you
Forever shall I kneel to you, for God
Answered my prayers with a beauty beyond senses
And I will do anything for your love and happiness
You're so intelligent, quite humble and elegant
Make everything around me look so irrelevant
In my dreams, we used to kiss by the creek
And the purity of your lips cooled the blush from my cheeks
Remember that baby, (yeah sweetie I still do)
Remember when I came down to your town and said:

[Hook: Roger Peterson (Michele van der Aa)] (x2)
I love you (I know)
I love you (I know, I know, I know)
I love you (and yes I will)
I love you (live to love you for real)

[Verse 2: Cilvaringz]
So in the eyes of the beholder, creator of all
You came forth from a condo in Hong Kong, I was live
With The RZA on stage, doing my politics
It was the thing that would consolidate our minds and get
Stronger by the will of God, I fell in love
Deeply, you were kind and you would teach me
You were beautiful and truthful, supporter of peace
Who sympathized with my people in the Middle East
And though we spent most our times apart
We would call every day and you would conquer my heart
I praise God for your coming to my life as my wife
For if you die once, it means I die twice
Always supportive to my music and dreams
Always understanding things are more difficult than they seem
Always by my side, your eyes, so green
Your smile, so kind, you're mine, my queen

[Chorus: Roger Peterson (Michele van der Aa)] (x2)
I love you (I know)
I love you (I know, I know, I know)
I love you (and yes I will)
I love you (live to love you for real)

[Hook: Cilvaringz]
You all that I need I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me I keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, everything about you
On top of that you always real, keep it true, c'mon
You all that I need I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me I keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, everything about you
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu girl

[Outro: Eslam Jawaad in classic Arabic]
With my final look upon you
I spoke to my soul and said to it: Why?
Why did you propel me to talk to her?
If only I ignored you
I would be in a different state from this depressive one
But now all I know is pain, and sadness
And I will miss you my dearest
This is fate and destiny my love, fate and destiny
