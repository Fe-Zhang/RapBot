[Intro: Cilvaringz]
Welcome to the streets of Arabia
Where people live, like you live
Where people cry, like you cry
Where people die, unlike you die
These are the words of general Arabia
These are the thoughts heard in our streets
This, is what I hear, everyday
Death to America... people...

[Cilvaringz]
You may condemn, 9-11, for the innocent deaths
But they celebrate the shit for the political slap
In the face of the president of 50 states
In the face of his government who lynched and raped
Who colonized for the money which they own to slaves
But instead paid Israel for guns to be made
And those guns will be used on my brothers and sisters
Who get shot down and killed when they show resistance
And you dare to call us terrorists who hate the Jews
Even some blacks who they jacked for their acres and mules
But see a snake always do what it takes to fool
Cause we were living as one, they made it break in two
I mean, ask yourself who is occupying who
And many praise Sheikh Osama cause he's fighting you
And he's disliking you, he wants you dying too
Cause you rob the same people you be lying to
Israeli soldiers bring the heat and you're supplying fuel
That's why they smiled when those planes came flying through
What goes around comes around, people, I thought you knew
That's for slavery and robbery of our only economy
I see we know what you're doing, I see your philosophy
You rob my rich continent and make it your colony!
A bloody policy, cuz now, Africa is poor
And all our diamonds and riches lay in American stores
And now this, listen, I'm not a fucking terrorist
Because I speak against an occupying Zionist
I know some good Jews, many good Hindu's and Christians
I know some good people, regardless of their religion
But when they wage war upon us we show resistance
With no distinction between soldiers and citizens
Cause that's the way, they have slain Palestinians
And that's the way they have killed in Lebanon
And this under supervision of the United Kingdom
And now the British, have fell victim, to these bomb
And attacks, and it's not death they believe in
So fuck terrorism, they are fighting, for their freedom
Death to America, is what I hear, everyday
