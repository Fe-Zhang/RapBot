[Chorus 1]
Oh it's a good kind of burn, yeah
You love and you learn
Timing was off but that color returns
And how can I grab
All your attention
All of this help without
A fucking mention
I just want your love

[Verse]
Now it's midnight
No end in sight
Thoughts keep me up
Blankly staring at moonlight
Learn to love yourself you say
Oh I'd like to see that day
Solipsism no more
In this Hammock I lay
Ay, ay
Oh I just want your love

[Bridge]
Well is it true
One for me and one for you
I'm just fantasizing again
Of course we're just friends
But I still want your love
Oh I still want your love

[Chorus 2]
It's a good kind of burn
Yeah, you love and you learn
Timing was off but that color returns
How can I grab
All your attention, yeah
Oh I just want your love

[Outro]
But I'll never have your love
But I'll never have your love
Oh I'll never have your love
