[Intro]
Don't know if it's me or you
It's a push and pull
But baby, I know
I know we'll get through
What has happened to ya
Pick up the pace
Through the back door without a trace

[Verse 1]
Never stopping for that thought
Not looking back for what I once fought for
The feeling I always stopped for
Conforming to the rest
There's beauty in isolation
Far away from the world and dreaming
Still dreaming of that sensation

[Chorus]
But this is hell
Oh, this is hell
Oh, this will make me well
Not looking back
Not wondering if this will last
Away from that useless stress

[Verse 2]
Well I know it isn't good for me
Never really felt the need
You want me to look back
Can't pick between this or that
Isolate myself, can't look back
Oh, well I can't look back

[Outro]
(Woo)
My god, what has happened to ya
Pick up the pace
Through the back door without a trace
I'm burnt out, but can't see
All along you were trying to help me
Well now I know
I'm getting well
