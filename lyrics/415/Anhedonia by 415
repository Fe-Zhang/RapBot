[Chorus]
So let me tell you something
I am not here to fuck around
I'm losing my mind, yeah
Oh, I need to be strapped down
Darling, I know now
You run this town
You got me trapped in
This motherfucking cage now
Oh, this motherfucking cage now

[Chorus]
So let me tell you something
I am not here to fuck around
Iâ€™m losing my mind, yeah
Oh, I need to be strapped down
Well, darling, I know now
You run this town
Oh, you got me trapped in
This motherfucking cage now
Oh, this motherfucking cage now
