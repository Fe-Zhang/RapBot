[Hook] [Dan Johns]:
We ain't even on the same page
If I was you I wouldn't rub me the wrong way
We ain't even on the same page
And you don't wanna find out the hard way

[Verse] [Chaundon]:
Same page
Feed off of the same rage
A-Alikes, me and hip hop the same age
Born out of poverty, destined for greatness
Can't rush perfection, excuse my lateness
Runnin' off C.P. time
But I still find minutes in the day to say "The city is mine"
Y'all rap niggas is boring me
Everybody claim they runnin' the game, clearly I don't respect authority
Me here with Dan Johns, we see right through 'em
Treat 'em like Apollo on a Wednesday and boo 'em
Preserve my integrity
Niggas sell they souls to get in the top five, of course they won't mention me
And y'all know my steez
I'd rather be starving on my feet than start eatin' on my knees
Slave to the rhythm and rap's the new cotton
Quit thinkin' y'all ballin' and start watchin'
