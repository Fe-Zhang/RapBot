Supastition:

"Yo, some consider me a veteran
The people's champion with a southern influence
I'm from the golden age, when not many brothas was doin' it
I was infatuated, then with the love of the music
Now, it's too political and too much trouble to do it

But still, I feel blessed. At times I feel fortunate
To witness how the culture was before it turned corporate
My music aims to give it back to these cats
When emcees could spit and DJs could actually scratch

I run with the likes of throwback sneaker fanatics
And crate diggers that'll kill for what you keep in the attic
I drop automatic classics. Go platinum off of adlibs
I'm comfortable, relaxed as a Cadillac passenger

A nasty lyricist, i take it back to the slums
I get more attention and interest than a credit card from Capital One
Super and Dan Johns remaster the language arts
Trying to give these commercial rappers a fuckin' change of heart"

Dan Johns:

"I'm seeing through your facade, you're not actually hard
While everyday, I'm face to face with unsurpassable odds
I'm not talking bout these factions and squads
I'm talking batches and spars, stereotypes, irrational thought

Show promoters want us jackin' them off
Or else we're working off the door
And everybody knows that'll be short
Everybody rolls for my show, outta respect
But I gotta pay the sound man outta my check?
Screw that, homie!

When friends turned their back on me
It was me, my family ties and rap only
My sanity lies in how I'm handling mics
Every song's an episode cause I channel my life

Through the art. Never losing my spark
Maneuvering smart
If you don't hear me spit it, its not true to my heart
Or my arteries and veins. Rappers ought to be ashamed
Especially those that got caught up in the fame

I'm caught up in the same element that led my favorite emcee to write "Eric B. as President"
My therapy and medicine is H-I-P-H-O-P coming from the 8-4-3
I'm a vet!"

Supastition:

"I'm an experienced professional. The skills are unquestionable
Is that the best you could do? I'm ten times fresher than you
Three times doper than most, which leads to an overdose
So many hate Supastition cause I don't take a local approach

I'm not concerned with the low blows you supposedly wrote
I'm too focused on taking over the coast
And I still remain the topic of my enemies dreams
So much beef, I should dispense it in vending machines"

Dan Johns:

"I'm trapped in a rat race with a bad taste in my mouth
Executives doubt fans can relate to the South
For checking this out, thanks for helping prove them wrong
Been paying dues so long, I confuse my songs

Was it yesterday or last week? Last week or last year?
Been a trailblazer but my path's never clear"
