[Meeno]
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Bitches can't stand in, niggas wanna jam in, and they wanna ban him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
That come through clammin', nine in my hand an', and its not jammin'
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Hold on down the lot an', do it for them block an' and u can't stop him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
No more talkin', the guns are sparkin', catch em in the coffin

[Meeno]
Your mama wanted you to be
Money, Clothes, O's nuttin' new to me
I'm that nigga that the bitches always talking about
Same bitch in the morning, pop dead in the mouth
I'm the same cat that pop up in well hotel career-a
Birth from Australi-a, Mansion in ammer-a(?)
Meeno bust in my face and make my skit clearer
Meeno whats up with Mase? act like i can't hear ya
Stop asking questions call chinese Sarah
One with all the tattoos like fucking rap dudes
Then call Nickie Dean, one who like a dick clean
Telling me to drop a hot 16
With the condoms, the hydro with Spanish Irene
At the double tree-sweats room 6-19
Its me, Grease, E-Snapps & Full Figga
Rippin' rock-house cause

[Chorus]
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Bitches can't stand in, niggas wanna jam in, and they wanna ban him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
That come through clammin', nine in my hand an', and its not jammin'
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
Hold on down the lot an', do it for them block an' and u can't stop him
I'M THAT NIGGA!!
No more talkin', the guns are sparkin', catch em in the coffin

[Meeno]
Come through with the fuse on the block
New S-Class drop with the coochie top
That nigga with bricks on parole that due to dot
That nigga got a album that yo dudes due to cop
Nigga that the block love, the cops hate
I'm the nigga that cop birds, get eights
Who's the last nigga u heard spit this great
No other than myself and uhh late great notorious
With the thugs niggas get no love
Act up, First slapped up and wrapped up
I'm a nigga that blacked up, caddilaced up
The black semi-automatic, the mac niggas up
I'm living it up, bitches giving it up
Main reason why niggas not giving a fuck
I'm the nigga of the niggas that sitting next to the nigga
What the fuck u figga?

[Chorus]

[Meeno]
For 4 days straight the same gear
Fifth day, fifty K on Cartier wrist-wear
Sixth day, flood it, I need more than the glow
World was made in 7 days yo niggas movin' too slow
That's why I'm speed-ballin', haters say its callin'
They pray & pray for my downfalling
I’m that nigga, Grease, stop the beat
I just wanted to say I’m that nigga, Grease, drop the beat
I'M THAT NIGGA!!!

[Chorus]
