All around the country cost to cost
People say what you like most
I don't want to brag I don't want to bost
I always tellum I like toast
Yeah toast
Yeah toast
I get up in the morning about 6 am
Have a lil jelly have a lil jam
Take a peace of bread in the slot
Push down the leaver and the whires get hot
You get toast
Yeah toast
Yeah toast
Now there's no seekret to toasting perfection
There is a dile on the side and you make your selection
Push to the dark or the ligth and then
If it pops to soon just press down again
Make toast
Yeah toast
Ungh toast
When the first cave man drove in from the drags
Didn't know what would go with the bakon and the eggs
Must have been a genus got it in his head
Plug the toaster in to the wall buy a bag of bread
Make toast
Yeah toast
Ugh toast
(french words)
Oh wii bonjor mor covancan

Oie mosharie th'Eiffel Tower
Oui Marie bug Bonsoir monsowa

French toast
From the bottome of the bob and tom show
