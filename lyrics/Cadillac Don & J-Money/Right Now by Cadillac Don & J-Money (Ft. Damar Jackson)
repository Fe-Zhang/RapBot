I told her I can’t wait no longer, I just wanna hit it right now (right now)
Right now (right now)
I’m coming through to put it on you, tell me “Come and get it right now" (right now)
Right now (right now)
Just say the word and I’m there
Beat it, beat it, beat it while I’m pulling on your hair
Tell me "Come and get it right now"
Tell me "Come and get it right now"
Right now, right now

[Verse 1: Cadillac Don]
Yeah, she on my speed dial, I want it right now
Fresh out the shower, Imma beat it down
She like it in the kitchen, on the countertop
We be breakin’ dishes, and we don’t even stop
She my lil’ boo thang, and "there" she won’t do
And if she doin’ bad, I have her when her in through
And if she want Gucci, "Lady, I’ll buy two"
She keep it one hundred, she always tell the truth
So where we'll doin’? I’m on my way
Time pass, ain’t no need to wait
She keep it so good, girl watch me play wit’ it
She sent a picture of that pussy, told me "Come get it"

[Hook: Damar Jackson]

Right now (right now)
Just say the word and I’m there
Beat it, beat it, beat it, while I’m pulling on your hair
Tell me "Come and get it right now"
Tell me "Come and get it right now" Right now, right now

[Verse 2: J-Money]
I’m just fuckin’ throw of they dranks, ‘bout to give ya’ ass that business
Best dick on the planet, baby girl it's my witness
Put that thing on ya’, watch me beat, beat, beat that
‘Bout to leave your legs shakin’ when I hit that
Eat that "pumpkin pie"
Like porridge
Got a fuzzy peach
No worries
She want Cadillac Don, ‘cause her man is boring
She can’t wait no longer, so I’m in a hurry
And all her baby daddy do is play that X Box
Me ain't hubby, tryna find that kinky sex spot
The other day, my Jimmy Early'ed on your bed spread
You girl got that jarhead curved with just that wethead
