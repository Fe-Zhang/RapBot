â€‹[Chorus]

Oh my lord
I didn't wanna own my thoughts
Blind to the whole wide world
Oh I'm sure
Everything is so fine
If I keep a closed mind
So I pause

[VERSE 2]

Who am I to say if good really exists?
All we're tryna find's some meaning in this
So we create these worlds with our words
Universes with verbs
To help see through a mist
What if God's really a myth?
Would Sinners and saints still feel there's a risk?
Could we act any different
With no lynch pin
Would we give in to our feelings of grim?
Heart's Porcelain till the rigor mortis is in
Its awful but I think we all live in sin
What's worse is that we think we're all in the right
It's awkward when we see our thoughts were a fib
So mom what's the give?
Why do peeps die before they live?
And some kids don't make it to cribs
Why am I here instead of him
Please tell me this
Cores and our values
If my best friend was a gay black man
Would I stand by you or erase that man ?
Quote you the Bible like stay back fam
Would I really change up hate that man
Feel like you crap you betrayed us damn
Scapegoat
Feeling like you ain't bro
Feeling like you ain't the same black man
