[Intro]
Let's go
Get Up, get up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What we gon' do right here is try a lil somethin' different (let's go)
We gon' rock tha house
Concise on the mic
My man Kemo on the board
We, we gon' turn it out, we, gon' turn it out

[Verse 1: Concise]
I want it all, I want it right this minute
Somethin' got to give in this bitch
I'm gonna finish what I started, blow up and get rich
I took it from the bottom to the top, yeah you heard of me kid
You on some murder me shit? African niggas will spark it
Spread your name across town, with a pernament marker
I'm a marksmen, aim with the skill of a archest
Take a little of ya top, like a villian is bobbin'
I'm feelin' is harder, but I figuered I'm +fathered+
To these niggas I be +sonnin'+ 'cause I'm stronger and smarter
Keep a eye on your daughter, 'cause she hot and she bothered
Have her suckin' and slobbin' like Tina & Robin
I mean tell about these niggas, these rappers is not 'sane
Concise is a killah, admit it he got game
Tell me if you wit it, we wit it, we not playin'
You sleepin, wake up when the Tech start sprayin'

[Chorus X 2]
We gon' rock tha house
We gon work it out
It's not hard, but simple we gon' learn it up
We ain't tryin' to save money, we gon' burn it up
If you tryin' to get doe, nigga turn it up

[Bridge]
We gon' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We gon' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side

[Verse 2: Concise]
Let it go baby girl, let your hair down low
Pick up your life young sis, it ain't nuttin' to throw
Pick up a mic young brother, don't be fuckin' wit doe
I was once it your shoe co cuttin the coke
Lifestyles of the broke, bein' famous ain't a joke
It ain't it all it's cracked up to be
Whether you actin' or rappin' or black athelete
We all got to eat, so I'm fast on my feet
Pray to God I don't sleep
When oppurtunity knock, in the form of a beat
On my rap sheets, the ink of my pen
I got a feelin' imma see you again
'Cause I'm that amibitous, and I never go against ya wishes
I got nuttin' but love

[Chorus 2X]
We gon' rock tha house
We gon work it out
It's not hard, but simple we gon' learn it up
We ain't tryin' to save money, we gon' burn it up
If you tryin' to get doe, nigga turn it up

[Verse 3: Concise]
And just get that money, you can burn it up
And just slap that booty, 'cause it's firm as fuck
They say 'Cise, that's that nigga that be gettin' it right
Proved some talk with the hands, but I'm good with that pencil
I'm authentic, but you ain't nuttin' more then a stensil
A night out for us, you know it's crazy eventful
So please approach wit at most respect
The African King Click, down go another chick
Stick and move like I'm trainin' for the fight of my life
Imma die with a neck full of ice
I'm frozen in rhyme, stuck can't get through a line
When I'm finished imma smoke me a dime

[Chorus 2X]
We gon' rock tha house
We gon work it out
It's not hard, but simple we gon' learn it up
We ain't tryin' to save money, we gon' burn it up
If you tryin' to get doe, nigga turn it up

[Bridge]
We gon' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We gon' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We gon' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We gon' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
