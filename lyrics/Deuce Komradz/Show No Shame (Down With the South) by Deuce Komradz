[Chorus]
Down south showin' no shame
Got the girls in the club be shakin' that thang
Got a young playa wanna know wanna run thangz
You oughta see dem' girls in dem' damn G-strings
Be like pimp tight, body still right smokin' weed
Gettin' chiefed til' the end of the night
Gotta smoke a brotha now gotta get the club hype
I'm drunk as a skunk and I'm high as a kite

Why errbody wanna be down with the south? (Repeat 8 times)

[Verse 1]
First up Big Bruh yean heard?  Nigga what
And I'm Shawty from the south, yah see the gold in my mouth
We keep it crunk, we keep it hype, that's what cha want, that's what cha like
In and out all night but I was slick and I don't mind
From the front, from the back girl you know you like it like that
Don't stop til' I do, turn around trick I ain't through
You like me, I like you
You want money, from who?
I ain't got it not a thang
Keep poppin' dat coochie and showin' no shame

[Chorus]
Down south showin' no shame
Got the girls in the club be shakin' that thang
Got a young playa wanna know wanna run thangz
You oughta see dem' girls in dem' damn G-strings
Be like pimp tight, body still right smokin' weed
Gettin' chiefed til' the end of the night
Gotta smoke a brotha now gotta get the club hype
I'm drunk as a skunk and I'm high as a kite

Why errbody wanna be down with the south? (Repeat 8 times)

[Verse 2]
Why you hatin' bout' a trick yean know she ain't shit
I don't care cuz' I already hit, yall so-called playas make me sick
I'm a pimp for life yean know ask yah wife
She came over the other night she was wrong, but I was right
Now yah mad, dat ain't right
You wanna fight, get a life
Take yo' girl, not the pimp cuz' this right here ain't what cha want slim
Did that do it again cuz' everybody hatin' on me goin' in
You a prick, I'm a boy
You a amateur boy, I'ma pro

[Chorus]
Down south showin' no shame
Got the girls in the club be shakin' that thang
Got a young playa wanna know wanna run thangz
You oughta see dem' girls in dem' damn G-strings
Be like pimp tight, body still right smokin' weed
Gettin' chiefed til' the end of the night
Gotta smoke a brotha now gotta get the club hype
I'm drunk as a skunk and I'm high as a kite

Why errbody wanna be down with the south? (Repeat 8 times)

[Verse 3]

Smoked out , grilled out, did dat chill out

Tripple gold on dubs, Cadilac 4 do's
Rag top, livin' large it don't quit it don't stop

Got a girl on the flo' wit a wipe

[Chorus]
Down south showin' no shame
Got the girls in the club be shakin' that thang
Got a young playa wanna know wanna run thangz
You oughta see dem' girls in dem' damn G-strings
Be like pimp tight, body still right smokin' weed
Gettin' chiefed til' the end of the night
Gotta smoke a brotha now gotta get the club hype
I'm drunk as a skunk and I'm high as a kite
Why errbody wanna be down with the south?
