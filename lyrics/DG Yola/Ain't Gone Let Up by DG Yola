(Verse 1)
See I
Don't know
What y'all been told
But, I
Gotta ge-get me a big
Bank roll
Yes, a fat bag of that sticky and some bad ass hoes
So when I step out on the scene
Suckers already know
To start hatin' (Start hatin')
Start talkin' 'bout my clothes
You see I'm pimped out, come try to knock me for my hoes
I'm a real nigga
So I ain't gon buy them Eddie Gold's
I Ain't gon trick off with that bitch
And I ain't gon hang around my foes
I'm a get money, nigga
So fuck it, I kick some doors
Hit the block like the sun
And get rid of all the snow
You can call me a don
Cause of the way I flow
Hey, I'm a good role model
Just look at me as a pro
Gangsta gutta raised me
So it's Gutta 'til I die
Them suckers hate me
You can see it in they eyes
When I come around, they frown
Then wanna dap me down
But when I leave
Them bastards talk about me like a clown
But I don't give a fuck

(Verse 2)
I, just, don't
Give a fuck
Cause I'm all out with it
The game ain't dirty, man, it just the niggas in it
You can't even wear a jersey
They try to peep ya tag
Can't smoke a blunt of kush
Cause you 'round too many crabs
Nigga, get yourself together
Go get your brain a bath
Go to church
Start listenin', and get on the right path
Ya study long, ya, study wrong, ya, get it in or get gone
Ya live fake, you'll die fake
And that just the way it goes
I'm a gangsta young nigga
So I keep my mouth closed
My ears and eyes open
So I can focus on the shit
Around me
I know they gone down me
But all I wonder why in the fuck do they come around me
I gotta stay down
I'm a shine like a light
Stomp on all these cockaroaches
Whether I'm wrong or if I'm right
Nigga
Hey, I get money
That somethin' I like to do
You say motherfuck me
Naw, motherfuck YOU!
And I don't give a fuck

[Repeat Hook]
