[Verse 1: Big Marc]
In the middle of the night, Big Marc hit it right if you roll the cigarillo tight
Got twenty eight grams of the grown ass man, baby we living the higher life
Haze we blaze got my eyes on glaze
Sticky bushes of kush and purple grades
Feeling like I'm flying through the sky for days
I radio in keepin' the weed man paid like
Homie send me a sack, that's gon hold me, until we get back, off this journey, to a place not of this world

[Chorus]
We can chill just smoke and ride, cause you know I got that fire that'll hypnotize your mind
We can chill just smoke and ride, don't you know I got that fire that'll rearrange your mind
Sweet lemon peppermint and orange colored trees

[Verse 2: Sho Nuff]
Who got the hydroponic, sort of like Dre cause I got the chronic
Bombs atomic, astronomic cannabis sativa, leave it to beaver
Pay me like a parking meter, if you want a hit like Derek Jeter, smoke and ride in the grip two seater
Don't do blow, don't coke two liter
I got the fire to hypnotize ya mind, just chill baby smoke and take your time
Relax to the couch, just bump and grind, hit you from behind and turn ya blind
Sho Nuff sit on big wheels is that your dame in the six inch heels, she hot like Foreman grill but she rather pop a pill

[Chorus]
We can chill just smoke and ride, cause you know I got that fire that'll hypnotize your mind
We can chill just smoke and ride, don't you know I got that fire that'll rearrange your mind
Sweet lemon peppermint and orange colored trees

I'm smoking I'm so high
Illusions in my mind
A fruit and berry flavored trees
A cloudy disposition
A bong and twenty swishers
Sativa and strawberry leaves

[Verse 3: Big Marc & Sho Nuff]
Sho Nuff go half on a quarter
Man I got a date with the preacher's daughter
What's her name
Mary Jane
I got a sack too we can double date
Man stop yapping gon and ratchet
Nigga yeen ready for this rainbow basket
That's my dro be quick to pass it
Puff puff blow this hoe fantastic

[Chorus]
We can chill just smoke and ride, cause you know I got that fire that'll hypnotize your mind
We can chill just smoke and ride, don't you know I got that fire that'll rearrange your mind
Sweet lemon peppermint and orange colored trees

[Bridge: Kendra Foster, Jewell, the Brides of Funkenstein & George Clinton]
Huffin puffin chokin toke of icky sticky stanky
Step up roll and pack a pipe
Twist a blunt, roll it light a joint
Lay back and puff slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly

This is the dope on dope
Smoke but don't choke on its the shit
Plenty of blunt junkies have been known to croak on less than a toke of it
It's the bomb, that bombards the brain, the bong
Instant replays of plays to come, when, time will tell
Just smoking that shit, the good shit, pass the blunt, shit

Huffin puffin chokin toke of icky sticky stanky
Step up roll and pack a pipe
Twist a blunt, roll it light a joint
Lay back and puff slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly

I'm smoking I'm so high
Illusions in my mind
The fruit and berry flavored trees
A cloudy disposition
A bong and twenty swishers
Sativa and strawberry leaves
Sweet lemon peppermint and orange colored trees

[Chorus]
We can chill just smoke and ride, cause you know I got that fire that'll hypnotize your mind
We can chill just smoke and ride, don't you know I got that fire that'll rearrange your mind
Sweet lemon peppermint and orange colored trees
