What do you think will come of that?
I don't know (I don't like the look of it)

[Hook]
(I don't like the look of it)
When we pull up to the do'
Gator shoes, on 24's
Haters wanna throw them 'bows and (I don't like the look of it)
We do it big in every state
Big diamonds in heavy weight
They say they hard but really ain't and (I don't like the look of it)
When they see us in the club
Poppin' bottles throwin' dubs
Haters tend to cuff they gloves and (I don't like the look of it)
We do weight in major ways
Flif fy paint in major haze
Pop my trunk and get them thangs if (I don't like the look of it)

[Verse 1: Sho Nuff]
I'm grippin 26's in circles like roller rinks
Paint drippin like kitchen sinks, cut wheel in chinchilla minks
My ceiling Barnum and Bailey flippin like acrobatics
Women ecstatic, just push the button it's automatic
When I lay me down to sleep
Next to a superfreak
Rollin' around in lenin sheets, (Send her on a merry way)
I'm so explicit, so egocentric, blowin on Buddha
Your money short shrinkin' sort of like oompa loompa's
I like my crucifix, same as liquor on the rocks
You thinkin' I'm shoplifting?
Dots lookin' like chicken pox
You can find me in the coop
My product on every stoop
But if you hustlin' on my block (I don't like the look of it)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Caz Clay]
Chevy bubble, every color
Tops fall back like knuckles
Chevrolet seats that hug ya
Chinchillas on floors and buckets
This what we do in public
These haters they hate to love me
Comin' up like bakin' muffins
Your label ain't makin nothin
My cake mix is statements
Shorty check my ingredients
Baby formula ain't basic, you can tell I'm a genius
But they don't like the look of it
Monte Carlo with the kit
Women follow 24, so I'm choppin' on 26
Keep your nose up out of it cuz it can get real
Talkin' to twelve bout what you seen will have you reading in braille
Reason they ill, probably got somethin' to do with the paint
I got it straight from Willy Wonka, and haters mad cuz they can't

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Marc]
Shorty gettin' paper homie
That be why they hatin' on me
Daily cost are frozin' phonies, (Muggin' when you see a G)
What you know about my city?
On the block with Dubs and fifties
Got the clientele increasin', (Shorty I got what you need)
Pullin' up on 20 somethin's
Treble with the woofers bumpin'
Chokin' on the purple onion, (Willy Wonka Chevrolet)
Freezin from expensive pieces
Heavy starch and denim creases
Rock 3 on my white Adidas, (Diamonds in my Cartier)
I spit that wizardry
Magically, so exquisitely
Vividly I'm a misery
Suckas wanna diminish me
Damn it be pimpin all in me
Boppers keep your apologies
Swagger ghetto like Willie D
Haters don't like the look of me

[Hook]
