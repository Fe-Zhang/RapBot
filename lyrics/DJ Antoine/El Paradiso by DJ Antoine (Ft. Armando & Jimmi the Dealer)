[Verse 1: Jimmi the Dealer]
I'm done with counting these bans
I'm 'bout to pop all these xans
Baby girl, I'll take your clothes off
Or I'ma kick you right out of this mansion
Comin' up, I never had shit
Now we in St. Moritz, diamond's dancin'
Went to Medell√≠n, took my chances
Met up with a team, now we bandits

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmi the Dealer]
I lived a wide life, yeah
My diamonds shine bright, yeah
Girl, get your mind right, yeah
'Cause you stuck in the limelight, yeah
Hey mountain circle
Poppin' bottles with models
With Antoine and Armando
Viva el paradiso

[Chorus: Armando]
Woah-oh-oh, El Paradiso
Oh-oh-oh, so close to heaven
Woah-oh-oh, El Paradiso
Oh-oh-oh, so close to heaven
All of my life, all in my dreams
All in one day, up in El Paradiso
All of my life, all in my dreams
All in one day, up in El Paradiso

[Drop: DJ Antoine]

[Verse 2: Jimmi the Dealer]
I'm so happy how we made out
We partied with devils and angels
So high, when we come down we raise hell
We want this forever, can't fade out
Almost in heaven, we so close
All this gold and this ice got me so frozen
I met a red bone, called her Bordeaux
Yeah, she pretty, she bad, and she don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmi the Dealer]
I lived a wide life, yeah
My diamonds shine bright, yeah
Girl, get your mind right, yeah
'Cause you stuck in the limelight, yeah
Hey mountain circle
Poppin' bottles with models
With Antoine and Armando
Viva el paradiso

[Chorus: Armando]
Woah-oh-oh, El Paradiso
Oh-oh-oh, so close to heaven
Woah-oh-oh, El Paradiso
Oh-oh-oh, so close to heaven
All of my life, all in my dreams
All in one day, up in El Paradiso
All of my life, all in my dreams
All in one day, up in El Paradiso

[Drop: DJ Antoine]

[Bridge: Armando]
Big shots up in Saint-Tropez
We used to fly to Belize, but now we're in St. Moritz
I'm with the girl of my dreams, her chest and diamonds on me
And this is gon', oh, this is gonna be

[Chorus: Armando]
Woah-oh-oh, El Paradiso
Oh-oh-oh, so close to heaven
Woah-oh-oh, El Paradiso
Oh-oh-oh, so close to heaven

[Drop: Armando]
All of my life, all in my dreams
All in one day, up in El Paradiso
All of my life, all in my dreams
All in one day, up in El Paradiso
