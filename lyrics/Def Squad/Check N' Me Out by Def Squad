[Intro: Redman]
(Ah ah, chiggy chiggy chiggy ah ah) Yo
(Chiggy chiggy chiggy ah ah)
I know y'all niggas out there
(Chiggy chiggy chiggy ah ah)
That know if shit get thick what we'll do
(Chiggy chiggy chiggy ah ah)
It's time to let all y'all bitch ass motherfuckers know
(Chiggy chiggy chiggy ah ah)
(Chiggy chiggy chiggy ah ah)
Yo yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Redman]
If I gotta go out, I'm goin out "Full Metal Jacket" style
Reverse suicide to do or die
I'm broke, I lost my deal, my car, my broad
And me and my landlord, be at war for the rent
Yo E and Keith, it's time to rob and steal
See that First National Bank? I'm showin my grill
Fuck a mask and a glove, I'm worldwide for drugs
Turn the TV on, that's me on America's
Most Wanted, for most blunted
That tricky shit you did, I done it
We rock gear for deer huntin
When we do jobs, me and my dogs ready to get it
Snatch you out the 5 Series like I'm winning the Pennant
Even at 112 degrees, Sky's the Limit
Sodomized the style till you idolized the finish
Sucker emcees get stuck too, fuck you
And if you blink, I'ma show you shit I be up to

[Chorus: Redman (Def Squad)]
Cause if the shit gets thick, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if you actin all that, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if we lose our jobs, (we stick a motherfucker)
Yo yo yo, yo, yo yo yo, yo, (we stick a motherfucker)
I know you niggas checkin me out, yo yo yo, yo (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin me out, ha ha ha, yo (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin us out, ha ha (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin me out, yo yo (ch-ch-check)

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
Who want the Source, the E got 65 Mics
So I guess, I got shit that motherfuckers like
Some rappers, they choose to be disobedient
Dummies, advance your skills from intermediate
I'm suave with it, my rhyme I play with it
I cut the style up, and DJ with it
Can you help me? Ask Bill Bellamy what's the jam of the week
When he speak, it be something I freak
Who gives a fuck, I show and prove, I got juice
Drop my drawers and let my balls hang loose
The Green-Eyed Bandit, shuts it down quickly
Taking care of Business, since Strictly
Cats talk behind my back, I get heated
And bust a shot from my CLK two seated
The Squad do work quick fast in a hurry
Me (Erick Serm), Funk Doctor Spot and Keith Murray

[Chorus: Redman (Def Squad)]
Cause if the shit gets thick, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if you actin all that, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if we lose our jobs, (we stick a motherfucker)
Yo yo yo, yo, yo yo yo, yo (we stick a motherfucker)
I know you niggas checkin me out, yo yo (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin me out, ha ha, yo (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin us out, ha ha (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin me out, yo yo yo (ch-ch-check)

[Interlude: Keith Murray]
Now if your bitch is paging me you best to check your bitch
And if your bitch is in my whip you best to check your bitch
And if your bitch is on my dick, nigga check your bitch
And if my clique fuck your bitch, nigga check your bitch

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Ay yo, I'm sly as a fox, smooth as Hennessy over the rocks
Knock you out your boots, slide you out your socks
I see you checkin me out, you felt it
When I stepped in rockin gators and electric blue velvet
I see you checkin me out through the corner of your eye
You deny, but yo, you ain't got to lie!
You check me out till your eyes get sore
But that's aight playboy, cause that's what I'm here for
Check how I get biz
Me and the microphone is like The Junkyard Dog and The Haiti Kid
Violated, reinstated, genuinely elated
You're belated, you'll be checkin me out till the day I'm cremated
I keep you heavily sedated
Illified, illustrated
The original juice, not from concentrated
From up north to midwest to west coast to down south
No doubt, keep checkin us out

[Chorus: Redman (Def Squad)]
Cause if the shit gets thick, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if you actin all that, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if we lose our jobs, (we stick a motherfucker)
Yo yo yo, yo, yo yo yo, yo (we stick a motherfucker)
I know you niggas checkin me out, yo yo (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin me out, ha ha, yo (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin us out, ha ha (ch-ch-check)
I know y'all niggas checkin me out, yo, yo yo (ch-ch-check)

[Outro: Nasty Naj (Redman)]
