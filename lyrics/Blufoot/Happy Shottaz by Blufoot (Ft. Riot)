[Intro]
Shotters, the anthem
For all my jugglers, my smugglers
I was laid up in bed the other night
I was rolling myself a little summin', and I was thinking
If I was a juggler, dealer, a shotter, how would I run my game

[Verse 1]
My team is my team and my cream is my cream
Shit, you know we got skills but this ain't Guru and Preem
It's just Blufoot and Ri' (oh), I'll sell you an ounce
Happy shotters the anthem, turn it up loud
So whether moving a crowd or simply moving some weight
I'm busy making pounds, cause there's money to make
You can't fuck with my game, I got my shit on lock
See I sell keys of weed and I live next to a cop
I keep a G on the street and break bread with my flock
I'm never sick of my squad, I'm sick of sick kids blocking my cock
I got love for my shotters all across the globe
But in the UK we be shottin' on road
We be giving you that funk that be getting you stoned
This ones for my smugglers, I'm bringin it home
I got a boot full of skunk and a beat by Blu
And either way I'm making money so it's all on you
Happy Shotters, Lets all get down

[Hook]
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
Come on now bruv, can't you tick it to me?
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
Got about six girls sell weed for me
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
What you chatting 'bout four, I'm only paying three G
Gotta have that

[Verse 2]
This is strictly for my peddlars, shottin' out green
You know you need to watch out for them CID
And theres always a couple of heads that wanna rap for a fee
People will never like how you be earning a keep
See I roll with a click and we all like to eat
Happy shotters is the firm that put weight on the street
I got no time for haters they don't cut it with me
Boy I got to get this paper man, fuck the police
But trust me they will come, to fuck up your income
And then come, another court case then your done
I'm tryna hold it down, I'm upsetting my mum
And I ain't looking do another fucking stint on the run
It's a catch 22, when you do what I do
So if I find you're a grass I'm a bring it to you
See me and my man Blu come smash up your car
At 11 in the morning right in front of your yard
Happy Shotters, Lets all get down, It's real aggy

[Hook]
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
Come on now bruv, can't you tick it to me?
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
Got about six girls sell weed for me
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
What you chatting 'bout four, I'm only paying three G
Gotta have that

[Verse 3]
If you try to sell brown then we're beating you down
And you can't sell rock, you understanding me now?
We're straight thugging out on anyone who fucks with our pounds
This is our estate, thats why we're repping it proud
I supply to ten guys, that's a lie six are chicks
They ain't ever getting pulled cause they're way too fit
It's the way forward homie, trust me, the moves are sick
Not only do they pay me back, they're all over my dick
I never pay for my product, get my keys on tick
I've only got three days to get rid of this shit
All this talk of seven G's, I'm only giving him six
I might chuck him another monkey, I ain't taking the piss
This is business, money, bartering and politic-ing
Young hustlers in a fight getting money is a mission
I like to look nice, keep my seed laced too
He got a stack of boxed trainers he can't wear till he's two
So organise a big party, better make that two
One for me getting out, the other one for this tune
Happy Shotters, Let's all get down

[Hook]
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
Come on now bruv, can't you tick it to me?
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
Got about six girls sell weed for me
Gotta have that skunk, gotta have that key
What you chatting 'bout four, I'm only paying three G
Gotta have that

I need that, I gotta have that, I GOT TO HAVE THAT!
