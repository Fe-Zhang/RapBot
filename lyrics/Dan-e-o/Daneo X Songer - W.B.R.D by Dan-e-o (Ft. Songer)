[Verse 1: Daneo]
White bitch, Red dress
Smoking on the green just to take away all the stress
Now she sipping purple and she starting to wear less
Fully undressed, fully undecided
They will fuck you when their low but they will claiming that they're riders.  Always in the background [?]
I'm talking bout no cinema, my man are insiders
Heading to the top like some climbers

[Verse 2: Songer]
She's always telling lies, fam I swear that's the worst noise
Said she didn't rate me and she's only into Turk boys
She's gassing, I know that I'm her first choice
That's why you only hear my name, when you hear her voice
Colourful bars, she love the verbal, only smoking green fam you know we keep it herbal
Arm is on her thigh and with my hands I'm doing circles
Man i make that pussy so wet that's a pur-purple
Man, but she always takes it personal
Whenever I'm chilling, billing I'm missing her calls
Saturday's are for the boys, that's the first rule
I'm chilling with Daneo, we keep it thermal
The white bitch with the red dress
Myyy chest is where her head rest
Henny and flavours, man I got less stress
Skid, skkrt I'm off
You cannot press next

[Verse 3: Daneo]
White bitch, Red dress
Bend my knees backwards for the shit, no bench press
If I stick to this I'll soon blow no semtex
Snapchat, life can be gone in less than ten secs
Can't control my anger when I get vexed
But I just want to progress
Make money, don't get success, is the key
Swear down I will look up after Mumzy, cause she looked after me
If don't do it for me, then I am doing it for my team
I want that fast money but I want it coming clean
Smoking green with bro but this ain't no family tree
I said I'm smoking green with bro but this ain't no family tree

[Verse 4: Songer]
There ain't no tree here, but just look at how we branch out
My sister's making money while your sisters got her arse out
My team's winning
I don't fuck with people unless they fuck with mans vision
You man are bland chicken
You got Am, but my team we got Ambition
But I got someone on my mind, whenever mans chilling
I ain't the type to get distracted but this pretty little red dress, trust me it was mad different

[Verse 5: Daneo]
Now she told me that she don't wanna get hurt
Tell her what she wants to hear, I'm a fucking expert
I'm going in, no insert
Man trying to be American, Lil Uzi Vert
But nah, that ain't really you G
I got the brain, all I'm needing is the booty
All eyes on me like a cinema, nah I ain't in a car why can't you stall me
You can't fool me, cuz fam I ain't a river
People need to see more, I ain't talking about skin her
Born in highrises, while yours are going thinner
I'm a hungry fucking guy in need of some dinner

[Chorus: Daneo]
White bitch, Red dress
Smoking on the green just to take away all the stress
Now she sipping purple and she starting to wear less
Fully undressed, fully undecided
They will fuck you when their low but they will claiming that they're riders.  Always in the background [?]
I'm talking bout no cinema, my man are insiders
Heading to the top like some climbers
