[Chorus]
Dear Hip Hop, I'll love you 'til I die
To taste the grace of your embrace, I will try
My mission is to utilize my skills on the mic
To rid you of the losers, abusers and stereotypes

[Verse 1]
Dear hip hop, what is the state of your condition?
Niggas be dishin' fiction making my decision a mission
To rid them from the planet cause my tracks hacks their wackness
Raps they flap is dryer than habitats of a cactus
Fact is I'm raw skilled cause God filled me with the spunk to be
So phat, rappers need an elevator to keep up with me
My objective's to be selective with my projections
To carry ya beyond the barriers of new dimensions
So help me slit the slack bros with wack flows
I pack blows to crack foes sweepin' your reach from plateaus
With senseless scripts, their lips is paraplegic
While the level of my lyrics leave their legion with lesions
From when you gave me birth, I've remained true to your rule
Yet phonies try to hold me back like teachers did to them in school
My promise to punish poetic plagues won't end
Cause ever since I was ten, you been my best fuckin' friend

[Chorus] (x2)
Dear Hip Hop, I'll love you 'til I die
To taste the grace of your embrace, I will try
My mission is to utilize my skills on the mic
To rid you of the losers, abusers and stereotypes

[Verse 2]
Now bredren, I comprehend your frustration affiliation
Your evaluation from those outside your nation lacks education
Corrupt critics voice views with no validity
Claiming you're the blame for violence within vicinities
And promotion to penetrate privates' how they depict us
So they deface our albums advising parents with stickers
Hopin' that our shit will die out
They remind me of niggas in French class
Not knowing what the fuck they talkin' 'bout
Our expressions exemplify reality
Through artistic talents found in all municipalities
Cuz hip hop, you're growing like dicks during porno flicks
Yet pricks be on my back like slaps when I used to get licks
Man, even pops gives me no props, not understandin'
Why me and you are branded to be lifelong companions
No power possible could prevent me to proceed
To profess rhymes 'til death like a Muslim does a creed

[Chorus] (x2)
Dear Hip Hop, I'll love you 'til I die
To taste the grace of your embrace, I will try
My mission is to utilize my skills on the mic
To rid you of the losers, abusers and stereotypes

[Verse 3]
Now bro, I know who hurts you most besides those who are ignorant
And not articulate is niggas who figure shit lingers when
They travel down gravel roads of trend interpretation
These imitations cause no fascination but contemplation
Of how they came to commercial composure
Probably writing rhymes upside down on a crucifix the way they crossin' over
Unworthy benefit reapers, sportin' sneakers and beepers
While I be catchin' bags under my sights from sleepless
Nights, writing for life cajse I refuse to feel the e-
Ffects of being known by material memorabilia
No matter how they bring you down, I'll stand your ground anyway
Cause H-I-P H-O-P is in D-A-N's D-N-A
My tracks axe niggas like questions, I've mastered all
Styles to make rappers look wacker than me playing basketball
Sorry for those who represent what you resent
Like O.J. Simpson, I'm absolutely 100%
Hip hop!

[Outro]
Yours truly
Dan-e-o
