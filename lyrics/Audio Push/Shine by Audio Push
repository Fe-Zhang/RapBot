[Intro]
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Pricetag]
Microphone check two, mic check one (check one)
Gotta clique of real niggas in my section
A solid girl with no baggage, I still ain't met one (nope)
I see all of you rappers as my step sons
I called my last girl and told her be my next one (yup, yup)
She say pull up on her, touch up on her wet one (yup, yup)
And I had a pack of condoms but fucked around forgot 'em
Gotta stop at 7/11 to get some (Fuuuck!)
All I know is ball 'til I fall hoe (fall hoe)
Walk around ten band in my cargo (cargo)
You niggas still stressed 'bout your car note ('bout your car note)
I'mma fuck around and buy Wells Fargo
I walk up in this thing a hunnid' deep I gotta get it, ain't no sleeping
Cause I got a son to feed (yah), some of her and some of me (yah)
That's a simple summary (yah), they talk behind my back (yah) because they know they ain't in front of me (yah)
Me fall is what they want to see! (yah)
My momma said—

[Chorus]
Pray, for them niggas that hate
(break it down, break it down, break it down)
They just wanna be in your place but them niggas ain't you
'Cause them niggas ain't real
Wild on them niggas, put on all them chains
And shine on (shine on), shine on (shine on)
Shine on them niggas! (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on (shine on), shine on (shine on)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on (shine on), shine on (shine on)

[Bridge]
Bad bitches do you need that? (Bitches do you need that?)
I give it to you if you need that (to you if you need that)
I got it for you if you need that (for you if you need that)
I put it down if you need that
Tell me do you need that? (Tell me do you need that?)
Bad bitches, do you need that? (Bitches, do you need that?)
I got it for you if you need that (for you if you need that)
Let me know if you need that (know if you need that)
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down

[Skit]
Ice Cube: Ayy, so what's with you and that chicken head?
Chris Tucker: Oh! Man, she say she look like Janet Jackson
Ice Cube: You lucky

[Verse 2: Oktane]
I'm watching the sun rise in New York
And you just now leaving the club out in Cali
Wondering if this three hour difference gon' be the reason
That you chose up while you out there in the valley
'Cause we all know, boi the hoes be choosin'
And if the money right, then you won't be bougie
Why you at the studio? You don't do music
I tell you I love you and you telling me to prove it, listen!
These niggas hating on me, your girlfriends want me
And bad decisions always make for the best stories
And I don't know what you want from me
Because you the one I'm trying to wake up to every damn morning
And the people 'bout to know, they all bout to see us
So valet the cars far away from the Prius
Rap game didn't know it but it need us
If we told you what we did last summer, wouldn't believe us
But my momma said—

[Chorus]
Pray, for them niggas that hate
(break it down, break it down, break it down)
They just wanna be in your place but them niggas ain't you
'Cause them niggas ain't real
Wild on them niggas, put on all them chains
And shine on (shine on), shine on (shine on)
Shine on them niggas! (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on (shine on), shine on (shine on)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on them niggas (What it ain't, what it is?)
Shine on (shine on), shine on (shine on)

[Bridge]
Bad bitches do you need that? (Bitches do you need that?)
I give it to you if you need that (to you if you need that)
I got it for you if you need that (for you if you need that)
I put it down if you need that
Tell me do you need that? (Tell me do you need that?)
Bad bitches, do you need that? (Bitches, do you need that?)
I got it for you if you need that (for you if you need that)
Let me know if you need that (know if you...)

[Outro]
Gonna break it down (Let it play, let it play)
Break it down, break it down (Let it play, let it play)
Gonna break it down (Let it play, let it play)
Break it down, break it down (Let it play, let it play)
(Let it play, let it play)
Ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Let it play, hold on)
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
(That's what I was waiting on)
Gonna break it down, break it down
I'm gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
