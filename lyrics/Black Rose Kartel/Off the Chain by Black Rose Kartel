(Chorus) Baracus
You off the chain shorty
You off the heezy girl
Wanna do it from the front shorty
Wanna do it from the back girl
Wanna do it from the side shorty
Get on top and ride girl
You off the chain shorty
You off the heezy girl

[Nikki Bonds]
Got your two chicks sucking my dick
Battling try to see who gon' make me cum quick
Three-way one licking on the clit
With them pretty ol' fine ass lips, bitch
And them thick brown round ass tits, bitch
Juicy cutie with them wide ass hips, bitch
It don't matter any shape or size
I like 'em shorty, stocky, phat ass, thick thighs
How you like it girl from the side?
Better yet get on top and you ride
Like 1100, see you gun it, got them hoes screaming
"Ohh daddy I'm cumming" Make them fuck fists
Got the dick up in the stomach
Nikki Bonds getting my loot warm
Hoes eating bananas, getting their fruit warm
Swear their newly, thinking my name fruit corn
Beating off to me, broke the food chart
Run bitch, is like damn you hoe-ly it
They be feeling like the dick up in my colon
Suck it 'til it's pun, drunk, then swallow it

(Chorus) Baracus

[Goldie Mack]
You off the chain shorty let's get it popping
All I wanna see is your panties dropping
Wanna hit it from the back
Wanna hit it from the front
Why don't you lick my dick like you're rolling a blunt?
Uh, you off the heezy shorty, lay down be easy shorty
Goldie Mack fuck all night, believe me shorty
Ride shorty let's get it popping
All I wanna see is your panties dropping
Ride shorty let's get it popping
All I wanna see is your panties dropping

[Elohim]
Now what I do from the front, to the back, wear that
To the floor seat game, it won't cost you a thing
It's off the chain shorty, re-floss them things
Toss Champaign in the back, with the gat
Rocking floor seat chains, hoes playing games
Be flossing in the Range, tossing dames in the Range
Got them hoes giving me brains in the Range
'Til I'm drained, fuck 'em
Kick 'em out the Range, fuck 'em
Hoes don't cost a thing, fuck 'em

(Chorus) Baracus

[Elohim]
What's shaking shorty? What's happening girl?
Let's get it cracking shorty, what's popping girl?
I got you open shorty, I know you're horny girl?
I like them gangsta shorties, I like them thug girls
We ain't hating shorty, love is love girl
Keep it real shorty, Champaign, Jacuzzi's girl
I got a Camcorder shorty, ready to make this movie girl
All about them dollars shorty, all about that paper girl

[Uncredited female]
Yo, you off the chain daddy, you off the heezy boy
I want it from the front daddy; I want it from the back boy
I want it from the side daddy, yo I wants to ride boy
Yo, you off the chain daddy, you off the heezy boy
Cristal and Jacuzzi's daddy, yo I ain't no hoochie boy
You want some of this booty daddy? You gotta pay for this coochie boy
So, what's popping daddy? When are you taking me shopping boy?
Diamonds and Gators daddy, Gucci's and Kool G boy
Yo it's about that cash daddy; it's about that paper boy
'Cause you're off the chain daddy, you off the heezy boy

(Chorus) Baracus
