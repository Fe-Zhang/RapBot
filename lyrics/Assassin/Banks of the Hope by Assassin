[Chorus]
Ahh-aahhhhh
Growing up on the banks of the Hope
Never give up and wi never lose hope
And wi never sell out and never sell dope
Now ironically everything weh' we say
They say is dope (listen)

[Verse 1]
It never break wi spirit growing up broke
Roll out smelling like carbolic soap (yes!)
A regular wi run boat just fi stay afloat
And wi run joke just fi cope
Hear wha nuh social mobility, limited scope
But mama mek wi know seh time longer than rope
Wi nuh frighten fi nutten 'cause we used to go without
From food stamps but now stamp full up wi passport
Hear wha juvenile nuh put no gun inna yuh Jansport
Fi collect no banknote, no that a di wrong sport (hey!)
Everybody want a bus like public transport
But hold the fort, everything curry like goat

[Pre-Chorus]
Put jah first and second and third
Watch we blessings come forth
Blessings come forth
Yow it is a miracle
Fi mek yuh thing shot
An' nuh end up a' Gun Court
End up a' Gun Court

[Chorus]
Ahh-aahhhhh
Growing up on the banks of the Hope
Never give up and wi never lose hope
And wi never sell out and never sell dope
Now ironically everything weh' we say
They say is dope (listen)

[Verse 2]
Marl road, top road to back road
Affi make a mark like the chalk pon di blackboard (hey!)
Affi do a ting fi mama pot load
Swear wi nuh, affi mek di Glock load
Hear wha now, the whole a Tavern
Hope flat back to common
Tin mackerel affi kill wi 'cause wi nah go bow fi salmon
And we nah go a no station, answer to no summons
Putting up resistance just like Beres Hammond

[Pre-Chorus]
Put jah first and second and third
Watch we blessings come forth
Blessings come forth
Yow it is a miracle
Fi mek yuh thing shot
An' nuh end up a' Gun Court
End up a' Gun Court

[Chorus]
Ahh-aahhhhh
Growing up on the banks of the Hope
Never give up and wi never lose hope
And wi never sell out and never sell dope
Now ironically everything weh' we say
They say is dope (listen)

[break]

[Chorus]
Ahh-aahhhhh
Growing up on the banks of the Hope
Never give up and wi never lose hope
And wi never sell out and never sell dope
Now ironically everything weh' we say
They say is dope (listen)
