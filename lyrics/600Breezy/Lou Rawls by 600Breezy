[Hook]
Said I got twenty thousand on me in the boof
A pistol on me I won't hesitate to shoot y'all

[Verse 1]
Baby girl take your shoes off
This a polar bear, not a rug bitch that shit cost
Think I'm Lou Rawls, nah for real bitch I'm Lou Rawls
Rocking fear of God
Only thing that I fear is God
I just beat the odds, baby girl, I just beat the odds
Fucks a couple broads, rap divas and some movie stars
Never been a fraud, play my cards, check out my ficauds
Foreign cars, has Maz, baby I got rods
I'm a walking lick, ride around with blicks, thirty on my wrists
Talking shit cause I'm young and rich, I came from the bricks
Busting bricks, hit the block with zips
I fuck with the crips and the bloods
Baby I'm a thug, we'll shoot up your club

[Hook]
Said I got twenty thousand on me in the boof
A pistol on me I won't hesitate to shoot y'all
I'm in a foreign I just had to take the roof off
Got cue flaws, who y'all nigga who rawls
Smoke Snoop Dogg, lot of dawgs like Lou Rawls
I'm too sauced, too sauced, bitch I'm too sauced
My juice costs, cough cough, take the roof off
Like Snoop Dogg, lot of dawgs like I'm Lou Rawls

Went through both lanes
Smoking woods to the membranes
Bombs like Hussein, kicking shit like I'm Liu Kang
Yousa peon, goofy mob, yousa poo stain
6 Wave, got on 6 rings, whips like Pootie Tang
I just do my thang while I'm strapped like I'm Major Payne
Sipping purple rain in these jeans made by Balmain
Bitch I think I'm Bruce Wayne

Ride around with two thangs
All my niggas who bang
